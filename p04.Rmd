title: "ggplot and Data Visualization"

Ggplot is one of the main things I hear people praise when it comes to using R instead of other programming languages such as Python. I have heard arguments as the plots from ggplot looking good and how easy and flexible they are. However, I don't feel like I have been able to fully take advantage of these features of ggplot. The standard graphs they create look really basic, such as this:

<br>
which doesn't look that good, although it might be quick. So I have used ggplot to make graphs quickly, but they haven't been to the point where I would consider publishing them. At the same time, I also see people making graphs like these:

and there is clearly a lot to learn about customizing ggplots. I have tried a few times myself and I constantly learn new things. However, I find that the mechanisms behind the plots are sometimes unclear, as the plots do not always behave the way I expect them to. Therefore, this project has two main goals. One is to learn about all the cool and useful features in ggplot to make good-looking and efficient plots. The other is to try to understand more of the mechanisms behind it so that I can edit the plots more sucessfully and not get stuck with unexpected changes.

# Grammar of Graphics

To start to understand the mechanics behind ggplot, I have to learn more about grammar of graphics, which is what ggplot is built on. I therefore read the following article by Hadley Wickham about [A Layered Grammar of Graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html).
