title: "Making a lab 0"
---


I made this lab instead of doing another lab from the course myself. When choosing what lab to make, I wanted to do a lab 0, since I remember helping a lot of students who were confused with all of the set-up and initial stages of the course. I also remember finding the beginning a little confusing myself, since there were several new components and it can be hard to keep track of all the different things that have to be done and all the different programs (e.g. R, Rstudio, GitHub, GitHub Desktop). I have therefore created this lab that will take the students to the basics of the course, how to use R and Rstudio, how to use GitHub and GitHub Desktop, and set up the class with a contract, initialing the portfolio webpage, and handing in their first lab. The hope is that this will make it easier for the students to get started with the course, because they get a direct introduction to R and Rstudio, GitHub and GitHub Desktop, get the main assignments and their repositories set up, and also get some basic practice with creating R markdown documents, creating and cloning repositories, knitting documents, pushing changes to their remote repositories, and handing in assignments by creating issues. It also has everything in one place, so that it will hopefully be easier to not get confused about what to do where and not miss out on an important step.

I think that implementing this lab would require changing both module 0 and 1 and instead have a module that is just plain onboarding activities and getting started. The next module, module 1, can then start directly on R programming since the students already know some of the basics of the programs we are using and have gotten started with the course.

I have made the lab with the following considerations in mind:

- I have tried to remove all the technical language that isn't essential for the students and which might make them feel overwhelmed when there are already so many new things. For example, the page that guides the students through installing R says "Install R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. I highly recommend you install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system â€“ use the links up at the top of the CRAN page linked above!". I have tried to not introduce any more terms than necessary and guide the students through all the steps, so that they can get a little more confident in their skills before exposing them to things like CRAN.
- I have tried to put everything the student will need to know and get set-up with to get started with the course in one place. That way, they can't get lost, which seemed to happen with the students this semester. Especially about the contract, since several students didn't know that they had to do it, where it was, and someone also wrote everything in the .md file and had to move it all over to the .rmd file. The current lab will hopefully make the students a little more independent during the onboarding, since there is only one place to go to and therefore a lower chance of getting lost or confused.
- Likewise, I have added a lot of scaffolding where the students are guided through exactly what to do. This is to try to reduce their cognitive load so that they can get used to the programs and going through the motions first. Later in the course, there does not need to be as much scaffolding.
- I have tried to take out all unnecessary information or cool features that they do not immediately need. This is again to reduce the cognitive load so that they can focus on the main things now and then deal with things like customizing the Rstudio themes later. I think that will also make the students enjoy it more. I would therefore not take out these facts and features, but move them to a later module.
- I have based a lot of the concepts I elaborate on, such as file types, on questions I got from other students or things I saw the other students struggling with the course, as well as what I found challenging and confusing myself. The lab does therefore hopefully elaborate on some of the current main points of confusion.

There is a lot of onboarding and introductions to do for this course, so this lab ended up being divided into three sections. It is currently written as a rough draft and they will need more editing before being ready to be used. However, I think a little workshopping on the language and adding in a little more air and numbered steps into the labs so that they do not become as dense will go a long way. I hope these end up becoming useful!

# Lab 0 - Getting Started and Setting up the Course

<br>

## Part 1 - The course, R, and Rstudio

Hi, welcome to the first lab in your data science class! The following lab will help you get an overview over the course, getting started with R, and setting up the course. After doing this lab, you should be ready to start fully engaging in the course and to code. There are a lot of new concepts and programs when starting to code. However, if you get past this first bit of the class, it will get more familiar to you and it will get easier.

<br>

### Course Overview

There are several components to the class. The biggest component is the modules. Every week, you will work on a module. Each module has videos, slides, and articles that will guide you through the material covered in that module. Some modules have activities that you can work on to learn the skills that are covered in the modules.

Furthermore, there are two types of assignments in the class: labs and portfolio projects. There is a lab after every module. So after working through the module and learning about a topic, you can try it out and show what you have learned in the lab. The portfolio projects are done on the side and are a place where you can show what you have learned in broader terms. Maybe you want to build on something you learned from a module? Maybe you want to try out something you learned from a module on your own data (like your thesis data)? Or maybe there is something else you are curious about that you would like to learn more about? All of these are great things to do for your portfolio projects.

<!--I didn't include any more information about grades and number of assignments, as I just want to introduce the overall structure of the class, especially since I will be referring to it later in the lab + they have all of that information available to them in the syllabus -->

<br>

### Syllabus

To get started with the class, you will want to know what is in the syllabus. Therefore, if you haven't already, read (or at least skim over) the syllabus. You can find it [here](https://smasongarrison.github.io/syllabi/index.html). There is a general part to the syllabus, as well as a part specific for this class. Read both the general and class-specific parts, that will set you up for doing well in the course.

<br>

### Downloading R

After you have read the syllabus, you will have to download the software that we will be using to program in this class. There are two things you need to install. The first is R, which is the actual program that runs your code and translate it into actions.

If you have a Windows computer, go to this [page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and download R from the link saying "Download R for Windows". There will be a number in this title which is just the number of the current newest version, so it doesn't matter what the number is, as long as it says Download R.

If you have a Mac, go to this [page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and download R from the blue link to the left. It will say "R" with a number and some other letters. That is the link you want to click on to download R.

If you have Linux, good for you! Go to this [page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/) and click through the relevant folders to get to the appropriate download file.

Click through the different prompts to successfully install R.

If you already have R installed on your computer from earlier, reinstall R to get the most up-to-date version.

<br>

### Testing R

Now, let's make sure you successfully downloaded R on your computer.

On Windows, click the Windows symbol in the bottom left corner of your computer. Write "R" and see whether you can see an app called R x.x.x where the x's are some numbers indicating your version of R. If you can't see it, go to the Apps tab in the menu and you should find it there.

On Mac, you can either click the Blue R icon with a grey circle behind it or search for the R program by clicking Command and space, and typing R. You will then see a program called R x.x.x where the x's are some numbers indicating your version of R.


You have now just opened R for the first time. To test it out, you can type in a command which is traditionally the first thing code one writes when learning programming. Type in "print("Hello World!")" without the first and last quotation marks in the white box. You should get an output stating "[1] "Hello World!"". You just ran your first code, asking R to print the text Hello World!.

<br>

### Downloading RStudio

As you might have noticed when writing this R code, is that the R program has a very basic user interface (layout). The design is rather old and there are not a lot of buttons and options. The R programming language is in itself very well-done and advanced. However, it is made for coding, not to have a cool layout and a lot of options outside the code. People therefore generally use another program to provide a graphic user interface (layout) that is easier to use and has more options. One of the main ones, and the one we will use in this class, is Rstudio.

You can download the Rstudio Desktop [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). The big blue button to the right should have the right version for your computer. However, you can also scroll further down on the page to see a list with the download link for Windows, Mac, Linux, and so on.

<br>

### Basics of Rstudio

Now you can open Rstudio and start using it. You remember when you tried writing your first code in R? You can now try to do the same in Rstudio. Type in "print("Hello World!")" without the first and last quotation marks in the little window at the bottom to the left, called "Console". That should produce the same output "[1] "Hello World!"" as running this code in R itself, as all you did in the console was to run the R code. However, as you might notice, there are several other windows in Rstudio too. The bottom right window is where you can see all the plots in your current project (which we will come back to soon). In addition, there is also where you might see any plots you make, as well as help pages for functions and libraries (more on that later). The top right window is your environment. This shows everything you have saved in your current R session. Since you have not saved anything yet, this will be empty. However, later, when we do start to save variables, you will see them listed in that window. Lastly, the top left window is where you will likely write most of your code. It is where you create documents with code that you can later save, similar to Word. Anything you run in that window will be displayed in the Console window (bottom left).

Now, lets try to actually do something in Rstudio. First, whenever you work in Rstudio, you would likely want to create a project. A project is like a Rstudio file that is saved in a folder on your computer, that tells Rstudio where to look for relevant files. Therefore, if you are doing anything that uses more than one file (which is usually always), you want to create a project for it. This could for example be if you have an R script(R code), as well as a data file that you use with your R script. To create a project, click on "File" in the top left corner and chose "New project". Then chose "New directory", "New project", and enter the name of the project, as well as chose where to save your project by clicking "Browse" and saving your project in the folder where you want it. You now have a new R project. You can see the R project file in your "Files" window to the bottom right in Rstudio. The file will be named NAME.Rproj, where NAME is the name you gave it, and the ".Rproj" ending specified that the file type is an R-project.

Next, you want to create a file with some R code in your project. The most simple way to do this is to click on the button to the top left that is a white box with a green circle with a white cross on it. Then, chose "R script". This will open a white page in the window to the top left. You can write some R code in this window. For example, try typing three things over three lines:

print("Hello World!")
3+5
min(3, 7, 12)

When you have the text in your document, highlight all three lines of code and click on the button saying "Run" right above the window. When you run the code, you can see that it pops up in the Console, the bottom left window. You can also see that it runs each line separately and gives you the output for each line. The blue text (with an arrow) is your code, while the black text with a number before it is the output. The first code printed the words "Hello World!", the second code did 3 + 5, which is 8, and the third line of code found the minimum value of 3, 7,  and 12, which is 3. The top left window therefore stores all your code and when you run your code from this window, that sends the code to the Console, where it runs the code and give you the output. You can save your R script file by clicking the floppy disk (save) icon at the top of the window to the top left.

Now, it is very useful to be able to easily save the code you run in a document, like the Rscript you just created. However, it can get a bit tedious to have all your code saved in the top left window and all of the output in the bottom left window. In addition, you would maybe sometimes want to add some text to the code and output, maybe to add an interpretation of some output or an explanation of what the code is doing. All of this is a lot easier in a file type called Rmarkdown, which allows you to have code, output, and text in the same document. The result is sort of like a report, where you see everything on the same page.

Therefore, let us try to make an Rmarkdown file. You do this by clicking on the button to the top left, the one that has a white box, covered by a green circle, with a white cross in it. Chose "Rmarkdown" and click "Ok" in the next box to open your Rmarkdown document. The Rmarkdown document will already have some prefilled information. For example, there is some text inside of three dashes (---). These dashes and the information between the two lines of dashes is called the YAML header. This is some general information about your document, such as the title of it, the author, the date it was created, and the desired output. You can easily change this information. For example, change the title from "untitled" to "My first Rmarkdown document". Next, change the name that got added as default to how you want it written. Remember to have your name and start and end it with a quotation sign (").

Anything after the three dashes is the main text of your document. There are two parts currently, the dark grey part is where your code goes and anything white is normal text. The difference between the R script you created earlier and the Rmarkdown document is that the R script only had one type of input, the code. While the Rmarkdown document has code, text, and as you will see later, output. Therefore, the part that would normally be in an R script, is the same as is inside of the grey boxes. The Rmarkdown document is therefore similar to the Rscript, just that you can surround the code (grey boxes) with normal text and output. Let us try this. Instead of having the three lines you had in your R script all together, try adding each line to each of the three grey boxes you currently have in your Rmarkdown document. To do this, leave the first and last line of the grey box (contains ''') as it is, but switch out the middle line with one of the lines of code from your R script. Then, add a sentence or two above each plot that explains what the code does. When adding normal text, make sure you do so on the white background and not inside of the code chunks (which are grey). Then, you can delete the other text on the white background that was there from when you created the Rmarkdown document. That means anything that is not in the grey boxes, nor in the YAML header.

Now, you can run the code you added. There are two ways in which to do this:

1. You can run each code individually in the document. You do this by clicking on the green arrow to the top right on the code chunk (grey box) you want to run. Do this for all three code chunks. You can see that the output of the code chunk pops up below the code chunk as the code is ran.
2. You can "knit" the report, which means that you run all of the code at once, and that Rstudio produces a report that contains your code, output, and text. Try doing this by hitting the blue yarn ball symbol that says "Knit" at the top of the top left window. You can see your report pop up when it is done in the right bottom window where you can read it over.

Running individual code chunk can be helpful when you are writing code or just want to see one part of the code. However, knitting the document gives you an overview of all of the code and output. Knitting the document also runs all the code over again, so if you were to make a change in a code chunk above the one you are currently working on, this could create problems if you do not update the code in-between before running some later code. This potential problem is not a concern when knitting a document, since all the code gets re-run anyway. You start with a clean slate.

If you look back at your files in the bottom right window (you might have to click the "Files" tab to see the files and not your knitted Rmarkdown report), you can see that there are two new files there. One is the Rmarkdown file you created with the code and text. The file has the ending ".Rmd" in its file name. When you knit this file, it will automatically save all changes to the .Rmd file and produce a new file with your report. Your Rmarkdown document it set to output html code by default (you can see that the output it specified to html in the YAML header). However, you might also in some instances see that it produces an .md file, which is often used for Github. The .html and .md files look very similar, they are just optimized for being displayed with different programs. If you want to sometime just look at your report, you can click on the .html or .md file in the "Files" window to the bottom right and chose either "Open in editor" which shows it in the same window, or "View in Web Browser" which opens it in full view in your web browser instead.

Be aware, that any time you rerun your .Rmd file, you update the .md or .html file. Therefore, you never want to make changes directly to the .md or .html files. If you want to change your report, you would instead change it in the .Rmd file and re-knit the file to update your report.

## Part 2 - Github

Now that you know how to use Rstudio and do some basics line of code with R, we will move on to how we will save our work in this class and setting up the components of the class, such as the grading contract, your portfolio, and your labs.

<br>

### Github

We looked at R and Rstudio in part 1 of this lab and learned how to write some basic lines of code and how to use Rmarkdown documents to produce reports with code, output, and text. Now, we will look at how we can save our work so that it is accessible for others and so that we always have a backup if we were to lose the files on our own computer. We are going to do this through a program called Github.

So, what is Github? Github is a cloud-based system, just like Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud. What they all have in common, is that you save your work somewhere else than on your computer. That way, if something were to happen with your computer, you could still access your files. The fact that the files are stored in a cloud simply means that they are stored somewhere on the internet, so that you can access them through an account, regardless of which computer or device you are using. There is a cloud system that is very commonly used among programmers and software developers, and that is Github. It is therefore useful to know how to navigate Github, so that you can participate in world as a true programmer.

The first step you have to take is to create a [Github account](https://github.com/). I strongly suggest that you use your Wake Forest email to create this account, as that will automatically give you student access, which offers pro benefits for free.

<details>
  <summary>What if I already have a GitHub account that is not affiliated with my school email?</summary>

  If you already have a GitHub account that is not affiliated with your school account, you can manually apply for student access. You can do this by clicking on the "Join GitHub Education" on [this page](https://github.com/education). It will require you to submit an enrollment verification, which you can get in a few days by applying for it on Workday. Be aware that someone at GitHub will then look at your account to see whether it seems plausible that your account and the enrollment letter belongs to the same person. It is therefore advisable to include as much information on your GitHub profile as you can to identify you. You can for example add a picture of yourself, a description of being a Wake Forest student, add your full name, and a billing address. If you do not add any of this information, your application will likely be denied, so make sure you do this too.
  
</details>
<br>
Be aware when making your GitHub account that this account is widely used in the programming world as a protfolio or CV or one's programming skills and that the accounts therefore often tends to be somewhat formal. You can use an user name such as "funnypunny", but if you create some good public projects and contribute to others projects with that account, would you want to add that username on your CV? Instead, make sure you add an user name you would be ok making public to a company or at your workplace later. It doesn't have to include your own name, but this could be beneficial if you want people to find you easier.

<details>

  <summary>Further tips about chosing a GitHub username</summary>
  
  - Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who theyâ€™re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.
  - Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.
  - Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
  - Shorter is better than longer.
  - Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.
  - Make it timeless. Donâ€™t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.
  - Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming. In Jennyâ€™s first inept efforts to script around the GitHub API, she assigned lots of issues to the guy with username NA because my vector of GitHub usernames contained missing values. A variant of Little Bobby Tables.
  - Avoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly recommend all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream regular expression work with usernames, in various languages. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen - or underscore _.

</details>
<br>
After making your account, you will also want to download GitHub desktop. You can download it at [this link](https://desktop.github.com/download/). when it is downloaded, log in with the same account that you just made for the online version of GitHub.

After you have successfully downloaded GitHub desktop, go back to Github in your browser and create your first repository. You can do this by clicking on the plus icon to the top right of the main page and choose "New Repository". You have to create a name for your repository, call it lab_0 or something similar. Then you can choose whether the repository is public or private. It is also good practice to add a README file, which you can do by checking the box for adding a README file. Click Create to create the repository. Now, you have an account on Github and your first repository, which is like a project. It is like a folder where you can save all of the work and files associated with a project. The repository is now associated with your account, so that you can log onto Github anywhere and find it.

However, running long and complicated code on your computer from the cloud can be slow and you might also sometimes want to work on your code even when you don't have access to internet. Therefore, we want to make a local copy of the repository on your computer, so that you can have the files associated with the project on your own computer locally too, and not just in the cloud. To do this, click on the green "<> Code" button in your repository and choose "Open with GitHub Desktop". GitHub Desktop should launch automatically and you will get a menu that says "Clone a repository". Cloning a repository means to make a copy of it. In this case, you are making a local copy (stored on your computer) of your remote repository (stored in the cloud by GitHub). The URL of your repository should be filled out automatically and the box for the local path is where on your computer you want to save the repository. You can chose a folder on your computer where you have some of your other materials for this class or somewhere else you want it. Be sure that you can find back to it again later though.

<br>

### Using GitHub

Now that you have made a repository and cloned it, let us try to see whether you can get the two repositories (same project) talk to each other. In Rstudio, click on the "File" button in the top left corner and create a new project. You can name it whatever you want and the rest of the information is not that important. The important part is that you save it inside of the folder that is your local repository. That means, inside the folder you created when cloning your repository in GitHub. Now that you have initiated an Rproject, open a new Rmarkdown file (click on the white box with a green circle with a white cross in the top left corner and chose "R markdown"), and save it the same folder with the repository (this should be folder you are currently working in). It does not matter what you name the file and you do not have to edit any of the text, just leave it as it is. You do however want to knit it, so click on the button with the blue ball of yarn that says "Knit" above your window with text from your Rmarkdown file. Wait until you see the output document pop up.

If you now go to GitHub desktop, you can see that the file name for your Rmarkdown file will be in the left window in GitHub Desktop. Make sure that the check box before that file is checked. The fact that the file shows up, means that there are changes to that file in your local repository (on your computer) that doesn't exist on the remote repository (in the cloud). When you check the box for the file, you are saying that you want to update that file in the remote repository. Then, before we actually send the changes to the remote repository (which is called "Push), we have to give this update a name. Write in a  short name in the summary section that is informative, so that if you look back at the message, you will know what you changed. In this example, it could for example be "Added a test Rmarkdown file". When you have your summary, you can push the blue button at the bottom of the page called "Commit to main". This action creates an update that is ready to send somewhere. Then, click on the "push" button at the top of the page to actually "send" the updates to your remote repository. Now, you can go into your repository on the online version of GitHub and see that your file has been added there. It is also possible to make changes the opposite way, by getting changes from your remote repository to your local repository. This is done through a "pull" (instead of push), but we will not be requiring doing that for this class.

<br>

## Part 3 - Setting up the Course

Now that you have learned about R, Rstudio, and using GitHub, you can get started on the course work. However, it might be helpful to set up some of the the assignments and requirements for the class. In this section, we will work on setting up the course by prepping three things:

- The contract
- Setting up your portfolio
- Seeing how you hand in labs

<br>

### The contract

The class is set up to be flexible and as a part of that, you have to fill out a grade contract where you set up which grade you are trying to get and a time line of when do to the projects and assignments required to get that grade. You can read more about this contract grading in the syllabus [here](https://smasongarrison.github.io/syllabi/data-science.html#grading-policy-3). There is a template contract that you can use to make your contract, so the first thing we need to do to make this contract is to get that template from GitHub and make our own repository for it.

Go the the following [webpage to find the contract template](https://github.com/DataScience4Psych/template_contract). This is one of the benefits of using GitHub, as one can share a repository with files that others can use, such as this contract template. To use the template, you want to click on the green button at the top right that says "Use this template" and choose "Create a new repository". Then you make the repository like usual. You can choose whether you want to make this repository public or private. If you make it public, anyone who looks at your profile or has a link can see it. If you make it private, you have to add Mason as a collaborator on your repository for her to be able to see it. It is therefore probably easier to make it public, but if you would want to make it private, there are ways in which you can do that too. After you have made a remote repository (in the cloud), you want to clone the repository to your computer (= creating a local repository), so that you can work on the contract on your own computer. To open the local repository on your computer, open Rstudio, choose "File" in the upper left corner, and click on "Open Project...". Find the file ending on "Rproj." in your repository and open that project. This works since the contract template that was made for you included several files, including an R project.

Now, you want to start filling in the contract. You can see that the repository has a .Rmd and .md file. Remember that you edit files that end with .Rmd and when you knit these files, those updates will show up in your .md or .html report. So, open the file ending with .Rmd and follow the instructions to fill out the contract. When you are done, knit the contract, stage the edits, make a commit message, and push your changes to your remote repository. Then go onto Github to make sure that your changes are visible in your remote repository.

Now, it is time to hand in your contract. To do this, you need to find the repository that is for handing in your contract for your semester. This is typically called year_contract, where year is the current year. You can find it by searching for contract in the repositories at the Data Science for Psychologists GitHub [course page](https://github.com/DataScience4Psych?q=contract&type=all&language=&sort=). Click on the repository and then the "Issues" tab at the top of the page. Then click the green "New issue" button to create a submission for your contract. You add a title, which should contain your name and for the main text, you want to link to your repository, preferably both the .rmd file and the .md file. That way, it is easy to look at the output you have created, as well as the code behind it. To link to your repository, add a square bracket "[", write the text you have to be displayed, for example "Contract .rmd file", then a closing square bracket "]", then an opening parenthesis "(", the url or link to your file in GitHub online, and a closing parenthesis ")". Do this for both of your files. If you are unsure of the link to your files, you can find them by going into your contract repository, clicking on the file you want the link for and copying the link to that page. If you have any comments or questions, you can also add those to your issue/submission. When you are done, you can click the green "Create" button at the bottom right to submit the issue. Make sure everything looks good and double-check the links to make sure they lead the reader to the right place. This is how you will submit all assignments for the course.

Congratulations, you just completed your first assignment!

<br>

### The portfolio

Now, you have to set up your portfolio. This is where you will have all the projects you are making for the course. You want to create a repository, based on the provided template, for your portfolio. You can find the template [here](https://github.com/DataScience4Psych/template_portfolio). Clone the repository like we did earlier for the contract, by clicking the green "Use this template" button and creating a new repository. This creates a remote repository (in the cloud). Then you also want to make a local repository by linking your computer to the remote repository you just created. You do this by going to your repository on GitHub, clicking the green "Code" button and clicking "Open with GitHub Desktop". Make sure to save the local repository somewhere you can find it later. 

The template you just cloned (copied) allows you to host a webpage on GitHub's page with your portfolio pieces. There are a few more settings to follow to publish your webpage so that you can find it with an URL. To do this, follow the instructions in the ReadMe in your portfolio repository. The Readme file is always displayed at the bottom of the repository, so you can scroll past all your files to see it. You should always look at the Readme file when looking at someones repository as it contains important information you need to engage with the repository. Readme files are very common, but not mandatory, so you might occasionally find repositories without them. You have already started on some of the steps in the Readme, so you can jump directly to step 7 to get your webpage published.

When you get your URL, click on it to see your webpage. This is here everything you do for your projects will be displayed. Save the link somewhere, as you will need it in the next step.

### Handing in the lab

You have made it all the way to the end! Well done! This is probable one of the hardest and most overwhelming parts of the course. However, these pages will always be here for reference if you need to come back to see how you hand in anything or where your components are.

The last thing to do before you are done, is to hand in your lab. First you want to go to the [course page](https://github.com/DataScience4Psych?q=portfol&type=all&language=&sort=) on GitHub and find the relevant lab submission repository. You can search for lab_0 and see whether you can find the repository for your course, meaning it has a year in front of it. Click on that repository and create an issue in it by clicking on the "Issues" tab at the top of the page. Then click on the green "New issue" button to the right on the page and fill in a title that has your name on it. For the text in the issue, you want to add the URL to your portfolio webpage which you saved earlier. Then if you have any comments or questions you can add them underneath. Then you can click on the green "Create" button to submit your issue (submission). That was it for this lab. Remember for future labs that when you start a lab, you want to clone the template repository (like we did for the contract and portfolio) and then when you submit your lab you want to find the repository that is specific for your year and create an issue (submission) with a link to your repository with that lab in it.
