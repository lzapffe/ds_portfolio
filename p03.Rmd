# Basics with data frames

Matrices can only take data of one type, while a data frame can have columns with different types of objects.

You can use summary(df), head(df), tail(df), str(df)

Data frames are a special case of lists where each list have the same length


# Tibbles vs data frames

The following are notes taken from the course materials.

Tibbles were made to make fewer assumptions (which were sometimes wrong) when dealing with data frames and to also display things easier. The tibbles will also often offer more helpful warnings. Here are some examples of differences between data frames and tibbles:

- A data frame will automatically change spaces to periods in column names. Tibbles keep them.
- If you try calling a column that doesn't exist. A tibble will give you a warning saying that that column doesn't exist, while a data frame will just say "NULL"
- Tibbles always give you a tibble when subsetting. A data frame can give you a matrix or vector depending on whether the subsetted data conforms to the requirements for those objects
-  Data frames do partial matching with column names. So if your column is "tree_hugger" and you call "tree", it will assume you mean "tree_hugger". A tibble will just say that the "tree" column doesn't exist.
- Historical fact: data frames also used to coerce strings to factors, but it doesn't anymore


# Useful dplyr functions

The first argument of dplyr functions is always the data frame. Dplyr only takes a data frame or tibble, not a matrix or vector.


Displaying data:

- names() - show the variable names of the data set
- glimpse() - show variable names and the first few objects per column


Subsetting data:

- select() - pick columns by name
  - If you want multiple columns, just add them as more parameters
- slice() - pick rows using index
- filter() - subsetting rows based on some criteria
- distinct() - filter for unique rows


Other:

- arrange() - reorder rows ascending
  - Add desc() as a parameter to make it descending
- mutate() - add a new variable
  -   mutate(
    number_of_cats = case_when(
      name == "Ginger Clark" ~ "2",
      name == "Doug Bass"    ~ "3",
      TRUE                   ~ number_of_cats
      ),
    number_of_cats = as.numeric(number_of_cats)
    )
- group_by() - for grouped operations (calculate per group, like split file in SPSS)
- rename() - rename columns


Stats:

- summarize() - reduce variables to values
- summarize.at() - like summarize, but with multiple variables
- count() - count instance of each value
- n.distinct() - counts number of distinct instances


Joining data frames:

- left_join() - Take everything that matches with x in y and also include anything left over from x
- right_join() - Take everything that matches with y in x and also include anything left over from y
- full_join() - Take everything from all data frames
- semi_join() - Only combine the rows that are common for both data frame x andy, but you only keep values from x. Essentially, it is like filtering data frame x to only keep the rows that is shared with y, but nothing is really combined from y
- inner_join() - Just combine what rows are in common in both data frame x and y
- anti_join() - Only keep what is different between data frame x and y


## Forcats

You can use path_package() to find the path for a file based on some strings to match

## Other packages

readr to get files imported properly, for example, not having all strings converted to factors automatically such as happens with base r


## Things to look at

### For advanced vectorized functions and dplyr project

1. Do.call() vs vectorized operations
2. Map.dffr in purr (this is depricated) vs vecotrized operations
3. .attributes function (not just dplyr)
4. Vectorized operations building on previous output. Now I only know how to do this with loops
5. across(), rowwise(), any_of(), all_of(), everything(), ~, .x (is column?)
6. !! from rlang to dynamically evaluate expressions. Uses := instead of =

## To do list

- Add in how to integrate base R into pipelines if needed
- Discuss piping (how to do it + benefits of it)
  - Less repetitive code
- Make an overview of the Tidyverse packages and what they do
- Do a deep dive into some of the packages and go over useful functions
- Discuss how Tidyverse usually has functions for things that would take a lot of code to do in base R - one benefit
