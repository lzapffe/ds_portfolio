This website contains my portfolio for my [Data Science for Psychologists](https://datascience4psych.github.io/DataScience4Psych/) class.

I needed more practice or experience in.

Current to-do's in the class:

- Work on portfolio project 2
- Make git pull request for contract
- Work through module 3
- Do lab 3
