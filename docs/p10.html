<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Suggestions for Course Improvements</h1>

</div>


<p>I started this project as a personal list of things I found
confusing, things that were broken on the webpage for the course, or
things I saw others struggle with. The list grew fast and I ended up
finding myself engaging more in the material when I was looking for ways
to improve it. I therefore started it as a project where I looked for
areas of improvements in all areas of the course, especially the
modules. I knew a lot of the information presented in the modules,
especially the earlier ones, so this project gave me an additional
purpose when working through all of it. In addition, I think this could
make the comments especially helpful, as they are my reactions and
comments while working through the modules, instead of just thinking
back to the overall course, which would probably have led to less
specific comments. Overall, the course is really good, so the
improvements are not to indicate otherwise. Instead, they are a
collection of bugs to fix, points of confusion, and general suggestions
that I have gathered while working through the course. I hope that they
will be helpful for improving the course in the future!</p>
<p>I will first provide my notes from going over individual modules and
then at the end have some more general comments. I have tried to refer
to the page numbers when available for reference when checking some of
these comments. A lot of these comments are raw comments that I took
while working through them. I have tried to keep them as my raw comments
instead of writing them down as formal suggestions as I think that will
be more helpful to understanding the train of thought that occured when
I ran into issues.</p>
<p>Note: I think a page was added after I wrote down a lot of the page
numbers, so for a lot of them (at least in the beginning), you have to
add 1 to the page number to find the page I am referring to.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="module-0" class="section level1">
<h1>Module 0</h1>
<ul>
<li>Guidance 0.7 has a link that isn’t formatted as a link and a title
with “##” that isn’t formatted as a title, both under the portfolio
section. Check the formatting in the .rmd document</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="module-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Module 1</h1>
<ul>
<li>In module 1, part 3, first video “Meet our toolkit” Mason says we
can follow along with her and the intro to code and then later on that
page, there is a video on how to download R and R studio. Downloading R
should happen earlier
<ul>
<li>I would have thought it would have been more logical with a setting
up the course module where you download all software and get it up and
running, without necessarily using anything</li>
<li>Would also allow for us to follow along while she showed us
e.g. Rmarkdown in the “Meet our toolkit” video</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lot of stuff isn’t explained enough for beginners in the “meet our
toolkit” video, like what is a library? Our having a logical transition
and explanations from calculation, to variable, to function, to library
<ul>
<li>“knit” isn’t explained, just used as if we were to know it already.
It comes up in more detail 5 minutes later</li>
<li>In the video we are also asked to “go to Github to fork the
assignment to our own Github” but we haven’t learned how to use Git hub
yet, that comes later</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Bechdel activity is too advanced. Should focus on getting to
know R and using it, this has more complicated functions and data
handling
<ul>
<li>Makes it overwhelming</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Would make the most sense to start with GitHub before the actual
programming, so that people know where to find the stuff that we are
using</li>
<li>For section 5, “Git and Github” video, we are instructed to make the
account with our school email address and then add another one. Would
have been helpful with instructions if you already have an account with
another email address to get WF benefits. This involves adding the
school email, then going to the student github webpage and adding am
enrollment verification to get the benefits</li>
<li>The “command line bullshittery” in 7.3.1. is a broken link - fix or
take out</li>
<li>Have a to-do list that gives an overview of the first steps, where
to start, and where to find information about it?
<ul>
<li>Would feel a lot less overwhelming
<ul>
<li>Now I don’t know where to go or what to do, it is a little scattered
all over the place</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also, have some additional resources on how to do basic programming
in R, like functions, variables, strings, lists, and so on
<ul>
<li>Not required, but for people who feel a little lost and want to do a
deep dive
<ul>
<li>I do personally do better if I understand more of the mechanism
behind things instead of just trying to apply it right away. Could be a
video course or something that explain R programming more in-depth as an
option if anyone wants a more formal introduction to programming</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>More clear instructions on how to use the course
<ul>
<li>For example, what is mandatory to do and what is just if I want to
learn more? Do I have to watch all the videos? Are the deep dives
required? What is RDD and ODD?</li>
<li>Possible to make several levels and tag resources with this level
code?
<ul>
<li>Like have some stuff that is required (level 1), then have a if you
still don’t completely understand, need more in-depth instruction (level
2), and optional side-quests (level 3)
<ul>
<li>Could also be color coded to make it less formal and not have the
order that is with the numbers</li>
<li>Would make it easier to see what is required and not (e.g. with
tags) and would also offer an easy way to implement resources that
students could self-select to use if they needed more instruction or to
learn about an interesting side-topic</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The how to make Git Hub branches YT video on 7.4 doesn’t exist
anymore
<ul>
<li>Same for GitHub’s learning lab</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spelling mistake where Hello is Hellow on first paragraph of page
10</li>
<li>What are the different file extensions, like .proj, .md, and .rmd?
<ul>
<li>I have had so many students be confused about this and have given
many crash courses about this. Would be beneficial to explain the ones
we use in the course clearly somewhere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No one seems to know that you always want to use Rstudio with an R
project. I have seen a lot of students work in almost every other place
than the Rproject and it makes things a lot more complicated and
confusing to them. I think it would be helpful to have some more
scaffolding whenever we are asked to work in Rstudio that helps the
students open the R project in Rstudio and work within that. I think
that would greatly improve the workflow of the students and fix a lot of
problems, like students getting errors of not finding a file because the
working directory is not set as what you expect it to be with the
scaffolding in the labs.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="module-2---data-visualization" class="section level1">
<h1>Module 2 - Data Visualization</h1>
<ul>
<li>The data visualization link on the module front page doesn’t work.
Seems like the link should have an “s” instead of “z”</li>
<li>Link to chapter 3 and 7 is for 1st edition of the book, not the new
second edition</li>
<li>Star wars activity asks about changing color of points. What about
going over some of the different plots, which is what we have done so
far? I think a lot of students could benefit from practicing that. We
haven’t talked about colors yet</li>
<li>Working directories are introduced in 18.1. Should come sooner as
students have really struggled with working in an Rproject, which makes
the labs and activities a lot more complicated than they need to
be.</li>
<li>18.4 talks about how we haven’t started data visualization yet. The
whole section is on tibbles and data frames, which we haven’t covered,
then states that we haven’t covered visualizations, which is what we
have been doing for the whole module. Is this a mistake?
<ul>
<li>Plotting everything here with base r when the section has used all
ggplot. This is confusing
<ul>
<li>Would be better to use ggplot and reinforce that
knowledge/skills</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maybe start the module showing data visualization in base r and then
ggplot to show how much easier it is? If you want to include both base R
and ggplot</li>
<li>I would have like some explanation about logic/aesthetics in ggplot
as this is something I have been unsure about. Even if only as a
optional deep dive or side-quest</li>
<li>In 18.5 it says that ggplot will be covered later
<ul>
<li>Isn’t that what we have used already?</li>
<li>Also uses pipe lines and pipe lines aren’t explained until section
23
<ul>
<li>Introduce pipes earlier ot at least link to pipelines lecture
earlier so that people who are confused know where to go to learn
more</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maybe uses pipelines in lab 2 before the lecture on pipelines
come?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Didn’t cover geom_smooth() here, just pops up out of nowhere in an
example in section 18, should have been in 15</li>
<li>Section 18 was just really random in all of this. Why are we doing
this here, it doesn’t seem to fit in this module.</li>
<li>Why are we doing Github again on page 19? It has some repetition,
but more advanced
<ul>
<li>Module 0 should be a set-up module, with all Github information
together, except for maybe more advanced fun facts or functions, that
could come later
<ul>
<li>You could have the activity be to set up the infrastructure for the
class. E.g. contract or portfolio repository</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Commit and pull doesn’t seem to be explain before in section 18.
Also how to clone a repository to your computer and issues. Should come
earlier</li>
<li>I think there should be a smiley face, which is just rendered as
:smile: right now, in 19.3.8.3. - fix?</li>
<li>There is a lot of repetition in section 19 compared to 8, not
necessary</li>
<li>Integrate ggplot cheatsheet at the end of the module? Would be
overwhelming at first, but maybe helpful as reference when working on
the lab?
<ul>
<li>Could also have a resources part at the beginning of the lab for
reference if anyone needs it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Incorporate the hint from the previous student not as a comment in
the source code for lab 3 but somewhere that is easier to find, like a
drop down comment?</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="module-3---tidy-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Module 3 - Tidy data</h1>
<ul>
<li>On page 23 it is said in the video that we need a data frame, not
vector or matrix to use dplyr, but it doesn’t mention that it can also
be a tibble. The page before this discussed tibbles vs data frames, so
it might be confusing to not also mention that one can use tibble. Now
it could look like data frames are better since you can use them with
dplyr, but not tibbles.</li>
<li>Mentions style guide for R in video about piping (23.1), but it
isn’t linked anywhere. Would be nice to have a link to it since it is
mentioned</li>
<li>Section 27 on merge conflicts in Github should be with pictures so
that we can see what it is supposed to be like even without finding 4
other people to do the activity with (since we didn’t do it as a class
room activity)
<ul>
<li>Also, it is not possible to resolve every conflict with Github
desktop, so maybe mention Git Kraken and have a section on it for those
who want to take a deep dive?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lab 3 has something that should be “_original” but got formatted
really weird. It is right before the exercises start.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="module-4---objects" class="section level1">
<h1>Module 4 - Objects</h1>
<ul>
<li>Hotels activity on page 30 has bullet point in output where there
shouldn’t be</li>
<li>For lab 4, why are the data sets called dn and lq instead of dennys
and laquinta? There is no code or instructions to make the shorthand for
those names. This makes it harder to copy paste code. Is that a mistake?
<ul>
<li>Could be easily fixed by adding a line with dennys &lt;- dn and
laquinta &lt;- lq for the scaffolding to work like usual</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Change “Add exercise headings as needed” in Rmarkdown after heading
6 to something like “Add headings for the next exercises yourself,
following the same formatting as above”? To clarify that it is less
scaffolding on purpose nad that we are supposed to make the heading
ourselves now. If not, it seems a little random and could be
confusing.</li>
<li>41 has a link with the text “a figure you made 18 months ago” that
doesn’t lead to anywhere</li>
<li>41 talks about interactive and non-interactive code. What does that
mean? Loops? Using a shiny app? Not explained later either</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="module-5---tips-for-effective-data-visualization"
class="section level1">
<h1>Module 5 - Tips for effective data visualization</h1>
<ul>
<li>Ppt “Deeper dive into ggplot” has equal sign to assign variable, not
&lt;- when she actively told us to not use “=” in the first or second
module. Should be &lt;- for consistency</li>
<li>38.3 should have plots, but there are none</li>
<li>38.3 says “barpots” and not “barplots” in the header</li>
<li>38.6 should have many decimals for first table, but the standard of
how many to report from R seems to have changed, so now it gives just
one. This makes the point that is being made confusing. Update the text
to fit the next standard of printing tables</li>
<li>39.5 has no content</li>
<li>Lab - 42 - is still using dn and lq instead of the whole name. Makes
it harder to copy paste code and could be confusing</li>
<li>Lab - states that we will talk about *_join() functions, but we did
that earlier, I think. Change text to reflect that students already know
the join functions?</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="module-6---confounding" class="section level1">
<h1>Module 6 - Confounding</h1>
<ul>
<li>Seems like there should be more videos on exploratory data analysis
<ul>
<li>There are slides for it and she said so in the video, but there is
nothing there</li>
<li>Maybe there wasn’t time to film it? Or maybe it is a mistake?
Clarify whether there should be a video there</li>
</ul></li>
<li>46 Lab - for the Whikham data, when she asks us to look at the
documentation, the code also includes looking at the performance for the
code, for some weird reason. Is that a mistake? Why are we looking at
the peformance?</li>
<li>46 lab - Mason said to comment that it took me a while to do the
lab</li>
<li>46 lab - Mason also said to comment on calculating conditional
probabilities and how this might be hard, there aren’t really any
formulas to show us how to this. Would make more sense to calculate
percentage, because people know how to do that and it seems less
intimidating than conditional probabilities</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="module-7---web-scraping" class="section level1">
<h1>Module 7 - Web scraping</h1>
<ul>
<li>Page 49.2.2 is lacking a closing “ for the question about smart
girls and sex
<ul>
<li>Lacking quotes all-together for the measurement example</li>
<li>Also lacking spaces</li>
<li>So go over and fix formatting</li>
</ul></li>
<li>My big question going through this module, what is an API?
<ul>
<li>Sort of happens in 50.3, but I still don’t fully understand it. Is
it a program? Code? Method?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The link in 50.4 isn’t attached, it just says “here”</li>
<li>50.4.3 doesn’t show the output for nrows, just the code</li>
<li>50.4.4.1 has just a bunch of errors, saying it can’t find a
function</li>
<li>51.3 - what is a resource when talking about the httr
functions?</li>
<li>Why is there an API key? So that others can see what you do? What is
the purpose of this?</li>
<li>The function html_nodes is deprecated and should now be
html_elements
<ul>
<li>Used in the lecture for page 48</li>
<li>Also, unclear that the functions she is using is from rvest.
Clarify?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Should 51.1 have bullet points in the first paragraph?</li>
<li>The book chapter link in 51.1 is broken</li>
<li>The “section on make” link in 51.2 just leads to the page we are on
<ul>
<li>I don’t understand that bullet point at all and the link to get more
information doesn’t help
<ul>
<li>She said she thinks she moved the order of the bullet points</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>51.2.1 what is SSL?</li>
<li>Page 51 talks about the hidden R file for your API key and curl, but
doesn’t explain it before 52</li>
<li>Maybe make the lab ask for specific things to visualize, like make
it look worse to have no mask mandate. Would offer more of a challenge,
require more creativity, and be more interesting</li>
<li>57.5, the skateboard picture should be higher up, when she first
mentions skateboard, as it makes no sense where it is right now
<ul>
<li>Move it to where it is being discussed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The link under the picture for 57.5 is unavailable</li>
<li>Lab - Took me forever to do since I didn’t know the different
between html_node() and html_nodes(). If you do not copy-paste the code
it is really hard to not mess it up. Maybe include a warning about
copy-pasting the code only or explain the difference between html_node()
and html_nodes() somewhere?</li>

<li>Section 59.2.2 is trying to show an error, but we don’t see it since
it can’t find the object gapminder. It is called later, so maybe move
the library call earlier or input something else that will make it run
until it get the assigned error?</li>
<li>The link for error style guide in 59.2.2 is broken</li>
<li>59.20, the testthat package is not properly explained. After some
independent research I have figured out what it does, but it isn’t
really explained in the section, there is just example code with no
explanation nor output</li>

<li>It is a little unclear how long we have to watch the videos in
module 9. For example, can we stop after the Q&amp;A section for the
UseR! talk?</li>
<li>We aren’t doing the annotated bibliography activity, are we?</li>
<li>The lab required running models in R, which we haven’t learned how
to do yet. Add some instructions of put it after the data modeling
module? Assumes some pre-knowledge about regression that students might
not have
<ul>
<li>At least link to a source to get more info about it or a
refresher</li>
<li>How do you get R^2? What does it mean? Should I use adjusted
R^2?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write what date (at least year) that the Late night shows on page 65
are from

<li>It would help give context to the conversation, because I was really
lost about why there were so many about the same topic and why they were
discussing things that everyone knows about and not discussing some
other obvious choices</li>

introduced</li>
<li>Starts a little abruptly, what is the singer_lm model referenced
later?</li>
<li>What is ecdf? I don’t know what it is or how to interpret it</li>
<li>I don’t think Mike would have agreed about these things being normal
or similar enough
<ul>
<li>He was really picky about that in the stats class, so I don’t how to
interpret that. It is debatable?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We barely talked about checking for these assumptions in stats with
Mike, so it would be helpful with a little more explanation about the
assumptions and how to check them</li>
<li>I don’t understand the section that starts with “It’s easier to
check normality if we plot the line that the points should fall on:”,
nor do I understand 69.2.5</li>
<li>What is going on with the “check_model” output? I don’t know what we
are looking at. Alternative way of checking assumptions?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>72.1.0.2 Why doesn’t our linear model work? I know it is because we
can only have binary outcomes, but this isn’t clear from the text. It
relies on people having background information to make that
inference</li>
<li>72.1.0.4 what exactly are GLM? Do they always have to be about
probabilities?

usually under the video, I first thought there was a video missing, but
I see that it is the same presentation as the one embedded under the
video. Is the first copy of it a mistake?</li>
<li>I don’t know what the recipe function does or how it works. It is
used with no explanation or introduction in the first lecture on page 76
<ul>
<li>Same with workflows, what is it and how does it work?</li>
<li>Would be helpful with a little more explanation of what this is and
why it is useful</li>
<li>It is used again in 77.3 without explanation</li>
<li>How does recipe and workflows differ from functions?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I don’t know why we are doing the feature engineering things we are
doing. Is there a list of something of things to look out for for
feature engineering? Also, what is feature engineering? I recognize it
from machine learning, but it isn’t explained anywhere for people
without that background.</li>
<li>What is considered a good ROC score?</li>
<li>What are you doing in the making decisions section? It is not
clearly described what is going on. I recognize it from machine
learning, but I think people without that background would need some
more explanation about what is going on, that we are looking at chances
of guessing right and wrong, and what the probabilities refer to</li>
<li>Shouldn’t we be doing cross-validation in section 77.4 and use that
to chose good features? Why not?</li>
<li>I don’t understand what is going on in section 78
<ul>
<li>Too much unexplained math
<ul>
<li>I just gave up and skimmed it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Would have been helpful with comments for the code in 78.4</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This entire module is a little unexplained, random, and technical
<ul>
<li>Needs more explanation, coherent narrative or topic, and to be
understandable for people without a machine learning background. Less
math (or explain it more)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Last video on 76 said we would learn more about testing our test
data set with k-fold, but I don’t know whether we really learned more
about it in the next sections. Add more materials on that?</li>

<h1>Module 12 - Quantifying uncertainty</h1>
<ul>
<li>The hypothesis testing page (83) is kind of confusing sometimes
<ul>
<li>The metaphors or other scenarios to imaging are confusing, would
probably be easier to not use them at all, or to introduce those
scenarios to illustrate a point before introducing the actual
scenario</li>
<li>A little unclear what is different between the different scenarios
we are looking for and why we want that</li>
</ul></li>
<li>83.3.9. doesn’t seem to work, it just states simulation with nothing
there</li>
<li>I was curious while going through the module what happens if we have
a skewed sample compared to the actual population. Would this be a
problem for the generalizability of the results? You could consider
making this a part of a deep dive comparing and contrasting traditional
hypothesis testing with bootstrapping</li>
<li>I deduced from earlier stats classes that the distribution we are
bootstrapping is a distribution of the difference scores between the two
groups. Maybe clarify what you are bootstrapping, when, and why
<ul>
<li>When are you bootstrapping just your sample compared to the
differences and why? Why can’t you e.g. just always bootstrap the sample
and use that?</li>

<h1>Other more general comments</h1>

<li>Making a ODD that you can refer students to if they want to make a

<li>Link to this cool video explaining pull request with lunch boxes?:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4bYIGnoS1k"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4bYIGnoS1k</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The template for the portfolio is easy to mess up
<ul>
<li>It would be helpful to have a guide somewhere about how to do
certain things in the portfolio, like attach pictures and add
customizations</li>
<li>I have looked at Benjamin’s customizations and I did a few myself,
such as adding another page for lab 11 and changing the names of the
tabs. However, I have run into some interesting problems that are
interesting to keep in mind and maybe explore and write out explicitly
<ul>
<li>For example, when making changes to the tabs and knitting, this
ended up creating a bug on my webpage. It will show the correct tab
names until I clicked on another tab, then it would somehow jump back to
the old tab names. I assumed that meant that the old names were stuck
somewhere, so I tried knitting all the files, I pushed it to the remote
repository, and I even republished the webpage, but nothing worked.
After a while, I tried building the webpage in Rstudio with “Building
website” from the “Build” tab and that fixed the problem. There is
therefore occasionally some use for building the webpage, but I am not
familiar with exactly when this would be the case or what it does that
fixes the problem</li>
<li>Another interesting problem is regarding the /docs folder. I tried
adding a picture I wanted to attach to my lab in the /docs folder and it
showed in Rmarkdown, but not on the webpage. Then I tried building the
webpage, which removed the file from the /docs folder. I therefore
instead saved in in the main folder and linked through it from there in
the Rmarkdown file and that works perfectly. The files later reappeared
in the /docs folder, but I wouldn’t be careful with placing things
there, which is weird, as that is where the pages to the webpage are
stored. It would therefore be interesting to have some exploration or
information about what happens with the /docs folder and figuring out
what to save where.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Go over some more advanced general Rmarkdown stuff. For example,
when you make a bullet list in R you have to have a line break between
the text that is not the bullet list, but before the list and the bullet
lists. However, if you have a line break after, but still in-between
bullet points, you get a higher line spacing between the bullet points
that come before that line shift, which is probably usually not
desirable. It can be hard to figure out what is causing it though
<ul>
<li>Also <br> causes a line shift in the html output</li>
<li>You can insert links with the format of <a href="url">displayed link
text</a></li>
<li>Similarly, you can add pictures with <img
src="URL%20or%20file%20path"
alt="text displayed above the image" /></li>
<li>There is no good way of adding pdfs</li>
<li>But you can add html output with htmltools::includeHTML(“filepath”)
in a code chunk</li>
<li>Text enclosed in ** will get bold</li>
<li>Text enclosed in $$ will become italicized</li>
<li>^[text] adds a footnote</li>
<li>And so on…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Throughout the entire course, you are referring to the Data science
textbook by Hadley. However, there is now a second edition of that book.
The first part of the book seems to be similar across the first and
second edition, but the later parts are different. You could probably
just change the links for the first few chapters, but you would have to
go over it more closely for the second. Also check whether there are any
new and interesting chapters to use for the course in the second
edition?</li>
<li>Clarify what is required and optional. For example by creating tags
for mandatory, optional, deep-dives, side-quest, more instructions and
so on
<ul>
<li>E.g. is the Hans Rosling videos in module 1 required?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There should maybe be a disclaimer that the videos you have instead
of the lectures are from a random playlist. I have gotten confused by
this earlier and it would be nice it was was mentioned explicitly where
this is the case. If not, it seems like we are supposed to watch it for
something. Especially in the later modules, such as module 13</li>
<li>Add cool and useful things that others to as optional deep dives? I
have seen a lot of our students do cool things I am kind only imagine
how much other cool stuff I have missed. I heard someone made
interactive graphs and others made APA style tables in R. I also want to
know that. Maybe a hall of fame or a module that is things past students
have done when there is something of particular interest. Such as
customizing the portfolio, cool graphs (including from the labs with
graphs), and interesting projects. That would have utilized the work
other people have already done and have us learn more cool things. I
don’t have the time to snoop in everyone’s portfolios, I just want some
pointers or highlights to where to go. You could even link to the
repository of the student after showing what you can find there. That
collaboration would enhance the class, because it is cool to look at
what others do and learn from others and it would improve our
programming.</li>
