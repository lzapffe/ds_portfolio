<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Git, GitKraken, and Advanced Workflows</h1>

</div>


<p>This project will look into GitKraken and more advanced workflows
with Git/GitKraken. First, it will involve switching from using GitHub
to GitKraken. Then, it will involve learning about more advanced
workflows that might not be 100% necessary for projects that I am
working on currently for this class, but which could involve a lot of
fail-safes for when I potentially work with more advanced and
comprehensive projects. It is better to learn how to do this now than
later, when I really need it. I also realized that I could need a little
more knowledge of Git after creating my repository for the portfolio,
then trying to customize it, and then messing it up so much that I had
to reset the repository, which also didn’t work because of merge
conflicts. I realized then that GitHub desktop is too simple and that I
need to learn more about Git to be able to fix things when I mess up.
This project ended up starting and ending in two very different places.
However, here are the goal I had going into the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>To set up GitKraken successfully</li>
<li>Learn basic usage of GitKraken, such as pulling, pushing, and
connecting to local repositories</li>
<li>Learn about more advanced workflows with Git, such as using forks,
merges, and branches</li>
<li>To become comfortable using GitKraken and more advanced
workflows</li>
<li>The final goal of this project will be to know enough about Git to
create a pull request from a forked version of this class to update the
contract template that was made in project 1, as well as change some
other minor problems, such as broken or out-of-date links in the
course</li>
</ul>

<h1>GitKraken</h1>
<p><br></p>
<div id="setting-up-gitkraken" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting up GitKraken</h2>
<p>Got GitKraken downloaded and signed in. It is now also linked to
Github (by following the prompting in the GitKraken tutorial) and I have
opened the public repositories that I have stored locally on my
computer. I can’t open the private ones yet, since I don’t have the
student developer pack through GitHub.</p>
<p>After fighting with GitHub student developer pack for a while, I got
it. They rejected me first, which I think is because my GitHub profile
didn’t have enough identifying information. So I added my name and
address to the billing information, a profile picture, a bio about me
being a Wake Forest student, my location, my full name displayed on the
profile, and connected my OrcID account. I can always remove things
later. I also got a enrollment verification that I tried submitting.
They didn’t want a pdf, so I converted it to a png. However, after
having submitted it once and gotten rejected, I wasn’t allowed to submit
the same documentation again (even though the problems were more likely
related to the GitHub profile information). I tried converting the pdf
to png again, hoping the document would have some different metadata and
that GitHub would let me submit it again, but that didn’t work.
Eventually, I had to print out my enrollment verification and take a
picture from my computer camera of the printed enrollment verification.
That got me verified within a few days. So, long story short, sign up to
GitHub with your student account to begin with. If you already have a
GitHub account, change all your profile information to identify who you
are and then hand in an application.</p>

<h1>More Advanced Workflows</h1>
<p>Most of this material comes from the workflow part of the <a
href="https://learn.gitkraken.com/courses/git-foundations">Foundations
of Git Certification Course by GitKraken</a>. The rest, such as
trunk-based workflows and some further details come from various pages
on Google.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="the-different-types-of-workflows" class="section level2">
<h2>The Different Types of Workflows</h2>
<p>There are many types of workflows and after having gone over several
of them, I will highlight the characteristics of the main ones here and
then evaluate what I think seems to be the most relevant to the type of
work I do.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="github-flow" class="section level3">
<h3>GitHub flow</h3>
<p>GitHub flow is often used in scenarios when you do not have to
support multiple versions of a code. One maintains a main branch that is
only for code that has been tested and which we know work. Then, one
keep different feature branches, one branch per feature or bug fix, to
develop new features. When the code for the features is done, one can
create a pull request that someone else on the team can look over and
then merge that branch with the main branch.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="git-flow" class="section level3">
<h3>Git flow</h3>
<p>Git flow is a more elaborate strategy that involves many different
types of branches. This flow is especially helpful if one has several
versions of a product that has to be maintained at once.</p>
<p>The flow uses 5 different types of branches:</p>
<ul>
<li>main - Production-ready code that can be released</li>
<li>develop - Pre-production code with newly developed features that are
in the process of being tested</li>
<li>feature - Working on a new feature. This branch will typically be
merged with the develop branch as code is finished.</li>
<li>release - Finishing touches and minor bugs for preparing new
production releases</li>
<li>hotfix - Quickly address necessary changes in your main branch. You
typically branch this from your main branch and merge it with both the
main and develop branch afterward.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="trunk-based-flow" class="section level3">
<h3>Trunk-based flow</h3>
<p>The trunk-based flow involves a different view on branches, as having
many branches at once, especially those that last for a while, can
quickly lead to a lot of merge conflicts (the same code has been changed
by different people in different versions of the file, without updating
the file in-between). Therefore, this workflow uses minimal with feature
branches, only if necessary, for example if testing out a highly
experimental feature. If one uses a feature branch, this should pull and
push to the main branch as often as possible and should be merged back
into main as soon as possible too. The changes being made to the main
branch while checking out (working in) the main branch should also often
pull and push their changes as often as possible. This way, everyone are
working on updated versions of code and there will be minimal with merge
conflicts.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="reflections-on-git-workflows" class="section level2">
<h2>Reflections on Git Workflows</h2>
<p>I don’t typically create code that needs to be in different versions,
so I think something like Git flow that has 5 different types of
branches might be a little more complicated than what I need. However, I
find the idea of using GitHub flow, with only feature and main branches,
intriguing. I get the benefit of using a trunk-based method, so that one
doesn’t have to deal with merge conflicts all the time. However, even
though it requires a little more work in terms of keeping an overview to
make sure features aren’t overlapping, it seems like the workflow could
be better organized with a flow like GitHub. For example, if working on
some data wrangling, I could have one branch for main, one for running
some more advanced models, one for data wrangling, and one for drawing
inferences from some statistical tests. This would separate the
different actions more and also give a much better overview (at least in
GitKraken) of the different mini-projects I am working on. I therefore
want to try out using GitHub with GitKraken and see how much of a
problem merge conflicts might become. If it gets too complicated, a
trunk-based method might be better. However, I do want to at least try
to GitHub flow method first.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="mid-project-reflection" class="section level2">
<h2>Mid-project Reflection</h2>
<p>I have been working through the tutorial/help pages on GitKraken’s
webpage. It was kind of intimidating to get started with GitKraken
because there is so much going on. However, what I realized after
working past the initial set-up and customization pages is that I don’t
know enough about Git to learn how to use GitKraken. I therefore started
a side-track of learning Git with the Git <a
href="https://learn.gitkraken.com/courses/take/git-foundations/lessons/38787021-welcome-to-the-foundations-of-git">foundations
tutorial</a> by GitKraken. This course was very helpful to learn about
Git and since it was hosted by GitKraken, it also showed how to do
everything in GitKraken, as well as in the terminal. I therefore ended
up doing more of a theoretical deep-dive than the more practical I
initially envisioned. However, you will see some of the more practical
aspects being employed in the later projects, projects 7-10, where I
have used GitKraken and Git extensively. I also ended the project by
taking the Git foundations certification and passing it.</p>
<p>I will post the git certificate at the end and the rest of the
project will consist of notes from going over that course. I took most
of them on paper, since there was a lot of back-and-forth, so these
notes will likely not reflect everything I learned, but instead show a
little bit of it. I aspire to one day integrate all of the notes and
structure them so that others can learn to use Git and GitKraken from
the notes. However, in the meantime, I will use it mostly for my own
reference when I get stuck in GitKraken.</p>

<div id="part-2---learning-about-git-and-gitkraken"
class="section level1">
<h1>Part 2 - Learning about Git and GitKraken</h1>
<p>The Git course was hosted by GitKraken, so the Git basics information
will be integrated with GitKraken specific information throughout this
section.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="basics-in-gitkraken" class="section level2">
<h2>Basics in GitKraken</h2>
<ul>
<li>GitKraken lets you have several profiles, so you can have a work and
personal profile. The avatars can be different, you have different
integrations, you will have a different commit signature, and the
customizations you make are specific to your profile. You can therefore
for example have a black background for one profile and a green one for
another, to easily differentiate which profile you are working with.
<ul>
<li>You can also customize the theme of a profile further than the
option provided in Git by importing themes from internet and dropping
them in the themes folder in your computer under GitKraken (see file
path under “UI cutomization”). There you will also find templates made
by GitKraken that allows you to play around with option to make your own
theme</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can switch to showing initials instead of your profile picture
in commits in preferences</li>
<li>You can type any command or thing you are wondering about in the
command palette. It is the symbol that looks like a sparkly magic wand
to the top right in GitKraken. Search for anything you can find there.
You can also open it with Ctrl + p.
<ul>
<li>This command palette can also interact with external programs, for
example open a repository in an external editor, such as Rstudio</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are many shortcuts you can use in GitKraken:
<ul>
<li>Ctrl + l -&gt; Fetch all</li>
<li>s -&gt; Stage current file</li>
<li>Ctrl + shift + s -&gt; Stage all files</li>
<li>Ctrl + enter -&gt; Commit current files with current message</li>
<li>Ctrl + shift + enter -&gt; Stage all files and commit with current
message</li>
<li>Ctrl + shift + m -&gt; Places your cursor in the commit message box
so that you can write the message directly</li>
<li>Ctrl + f -&gt; Search in commits</li>
<li>Ctrl + / -&gt; Opens an overview of keyboard shortcuts</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<div id="gui" class="section level3">
<h3>GUI</h3>
<p>There are 4 main areas in the GUI when in a repository in GitKraken:
- The commit graph is in the middle of the screen, with a graph with the
commit history and the commit message - This graph gives you a quick
overview of changes, who made them, and any branching or merging that
may have occurred - You can resize this graph to decide how many paths
of branching you want to show by dragging the arrow that pops up when
your cursor is in-between the branches and commit messages in the graph
- The commit panel is the right-side panel with the unstaged and staged
files and the box where you can add commit messages. You can click on
individual files to see the diff view of that file. - When making a
commit, you can also click on the arrow saying “commit options” right
above the stage changes to commit button and check the box stating that
you will automatically make a commit and push the changes to your
remote, instead of having to manually commit the changes and then push
them to the remote - The left panel has an overview of all the local and
remote repositories associated with the current repository and the
branches associated with these. It also shows you pull requests, issues,
and team work. - The tool bar is the top bar with quick access to some
common functions, such as: - Undo - Undo whatever change you just made.
However, this only works if you did the change locally, not remotely -
Redo - Redo whatever undo you just made. Note that this only works for
local and not remote actions - Pull - This is to pull any changes. It
will do a few different things based on what you have set as your
default. To see what you default it (and change it) click on the little
arrow and select another option. “Fetch” will only get the change, but
not merge it, while the other options will do different levels of
merging - Push - Pushes your changes remotely - Branch - Creates a new
branch for whatever branch you are currently selected (see the colored
branches/bars on the timeline window for the repository) - Stash - Stash
your changes - Pop - Pop your stash to your WIP - Terminal - Opens the
terminal to Git. Has autocomplete to guide you through using the
terminal</p>
<p>When you click on a staged or unstaged file in GitKraken, you can see
the diff view of that file, which is the difference between the
committed file and the file you currently have in your WIP (Work in
progress). The green lines are lines that have been added or the new
changes to the file in the WIP compared to the committed file and the
red are the ones that are removed or the lines as they are in the commit
(as opposed to the WIP). When you are in the diff view you can click on
the plus sign when the cursor is hovering over a line to stage
individual lines of the file instead of the entire file. There are three
different views of the diff view: hunk view, inline view, and split
view, try the three different views by clicking on any of the three
boxes to the top right in the diff view window. - If you want to delete
your WIP, you can right-click on it (it will be at the top of your
commit graph) and choose “discard changes” or click the trash icon in
the commit panel when the WIP is selected.</p>
<p>You can also edit files themselves in GitKraken, if you for example
just need to add or remove a quick line before making a commit. You can
also create new files within GitKraken. The easiest way to create a new
files seems to be with the command palette. That is the go-to anytime
you don’t know where something is or are wondering whether something is
possible in GitKraken.</p>
<p>When performing Git actions, you can often do these actions by
grabbing a branch in the work tree and dropping it onto another branch.
This can for example be done to merge, rebase, or add a pull request for
a branch. If you want to make customizations to these quick actions,
like add comments or assign people to a pull request, you can do that by
clicking on the pull request after doing the action (e.g. in the left
panel)</p>
<p>The changes you have made to your local repository that is not yet
committed, will be in your WIP (work in progress). You can double-click
on your WIP (it is at the top of your work tree) to open the commit
panel. If you hover over a file in the commit panel, it will show a
button that will let you stage that file. You can also double-click on
the file to get the diff view, where you can examine the differences
between your committed changes and WIP, as well as stage individual
lines in a file.</p>
<p>You can create workspaces where you group together several
repositories that are related in some way. This allows you to clone,
pull, and push several repositories at once. You can also click on focus
view for a workspace and see all updates for all of the repositories
that have been grouped together, such as commits, issues, and pull
requests.</p>

<h2>Basics of Git</h2>

<div id="git-concepts" class="section level3">
<h3>Git Concepts</h3>
<p>There are two types of repositories: remote and local ones. The
remote repositories are hosted on internet while the local repositories
are the ones you have saved on your computer</p>
<p>A commit is a snapshot of your files at a specific moment. The
workflow in Git is that you are making changes to files in your current
repository. This gets saved in your project directory (where you have
the files for your repository) on your computer. When you want to make
these changes more permanent, you stage them to indicate that you want
to move these changes from your WIP to the repository. This saves these
files from your WIP into a folder in the .git folder, called /index.
When you actually decide that you are happy with the files you have
staged and want to make all of these changes a part of your history
(take a snapshot), you commit them, which saves the changes to the
/objects folder, also in your .git folder. This way, you have created
history that is saved in the .git folder, in addition to the changes you
had from the beginning in your files when working on your WIP.</p>
<p>You can work with several branches in a repository. However, you can
only work in one branch at a time. When you are working in a branch, you
have it “checked out”, which means that any changes you are doing and
everything you see is from that branch.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="commands" class="section level3">
<h3>Commands</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Git init -&gt; The commands that create the .git folder. This is
where all the history and changes that allow you to go back in time gets
saved. If you delete this folder, you will delete all the history and
what we consider a repository and instead just be left with the files as
they currently are in your local repository</p></li>
<li><p>Git clone -&gt; Creates an exact copy of all files and changes to
a repository at the time of cloning it</p></li>
<li><p>Git revert -&gt; A new commit that works like an inverse commit.
You will still have your history with all your previous commits, but the
code will look like it was earlier, since the new (revert) commit
reverted the code to an earlier point.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can do this in GitKraken by right-clicking the commit you want
to revert the repository to and chose “Revert commit”. It will ask
whether you want to make the changes immediately (which will stage and
make the commit with a default message) or not (which will stage the
files, but not make the commit).</li>
<li>Note that git revert only reverts the repository by making the
inverse of the selected commit, not all the changes that may have
occured in between the current and selected commit. Therefore, you have
to do this multiple times if you want to rever the repository back
several commits. It is possible to do this faster in the terminal</li>

<h3>Div other things Git</h3>
<p>There are a lot of god practices regarding commit messages. Some of
these practices will be specific to the culture with the other people
you collaborate with. However, here are some general good practices that
many people use when making commits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only make a commit for one topic or change at at time</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have multiple changes at a time, divide them up into multiple
commits by staging only the relevant files per commit
<ul>
<li>This will help if you need to revert a commit for something, as you
could revert a commit with only the relevant changes, instead of
reverting a commit and having to tease out the changes you wanted and
didn’t want.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Don’t use punctuation</p></li>
<li><p>Use the imperative verb form</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g. Add a new file, modify the Readme file</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Start the message with either of these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feat -&gt; Feature added</li>
<li>Fix -&gt; Bug fix</li>
<li>Docs -&gt; Changed documentation</li>
<li>Style -&gt; Style or formatting changes</li>
<li>Perf -&gt; Performance improvement</li>
<li>Test -&gt; Tested a new feature</li>
<li>E.g. “Feat: Add search feature to commits”</li>
<li>Using these categories will make it a lot easier to search for
specific commits later</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Add * to the end of the commit message if you also added a
description</p></li>
<li><p>Git LFS (Large file storage)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Using the terminal</h3>
<p>I like using the GUI and not the terminal for Git, as it is easier to
keep track of everything. However, it didn’t seem too complicated to use
the terminal. Here are some basics of how to use it and you can then
google the specific commands if you need it for anything.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can open the terminal in GitKraken by clicking on the Terminal
button in the tool bar
<ul>
<li>The GitKraken terminal has autocomplete that will help you write the
appropriate commands.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use git log to see previous commit hashes and messages</li>
<li>When acting on a commit, you have to refer to at least the first 6
characters of the hash for that commit</li>
<li>:qa will exit the current section or window if the terminal asks you
to do something you don’t want to do, like edit a commit message</li>
<li>Example commands
<ul>
<li>git revert [hash] reverts the repository to a commit</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Final reflections and the Path Forward</h2>
<p>Switching from GitHub Desktop to GitKraken and learning more about
Git has opened my eyes to all the benefits of Git and how it can greatly
improve my workflow on bigger projects, especially when collaborating
with others. I have gotten much more comfortable using Git and I notice
that I can use the terms and concepts a lot more freely, instead of
having everything be this big mystery. I have adapted a lot of the
things mentioned here, but there are still some that I could probably
benefit from working on. For example, I tend to make big commits with a
lot of changes, that works as a back-up if I would have to change
anything, but it would be a lot more complicated than if I were to make
a commit for each change or topic. I think I have adopted a lot of the
other features though, and my commit messages are a lot better now. As
you will see moving forward, I am using GitKraken and Git for all of the
applied projects coming after this, which includes projects 7-10. This
project has therefore allowed me to improve my workflow, get more into
the lingo of Git, and learned to take part of the community that uses
Git, such as sending pull requests for changes to the course pages for
this course.</p>
<p>Although I have learned a lot from this project, there are always
things that can be improved and expanded on. Therefore, here is a list
of possible next steps that I aspire to take one day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewrite and clean up in these notes so that they could be used as a
guide for beginners to Git and GitKraken
<ul>
<li>Add pictures to explain everything and show what I am talking about
instead of just using text</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get more comfortable using GitHub online, as that also offers a lot
of the features GitKraken does</li>
<li>Work through some of the more specific tutorials on GitKraken to
learn some of the things I haven’t gotten to yet</li>
</ul>
