<p>Look at this book chapter that has a part on regex and which is what
I used for vectorized operations: <a
href="https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/regular-expressions.html"
class="uri">https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/regular-expressions.html</a></p>
<p>Also this: <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/regexps"
class="uri">https://r4ds.hadley.nz/regexps</a></p>
<p>Used the cheatsheet at this resrouce: <a
href="https://hypebright.nl/en/r-en/ultimate-cheatsheet-for-regex-in-r-2/"
class="uri">https://hypebright.nl/en/r-en/ultimate-cheatsheet-for-regex-in-r-2/</a></p>
<p>Goals of the current portfolio project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the overall logic of regex</li>
<li>Learning some basic regex expressions</li>
<li>Getting confident enough with regex that I can decode and make regex
expressions, even if it requires some Googling to look up symbols</li>
<li>Demystifying regex</li>
</ul>
<div id="basics-of-regex" class="section level2">
<h2>Basics of Regex</h2>
<p>Regex expressions consists of literals and metacharacers, which is
like the actual words and grammar of a language.</p>
<p>The simplest regex expression is to just have one literal and no
metacharacters. For example, you can have the expression “golf” which
gives you all the lines that contains the string “golf”.</p>
<p>Some of the metacharacters:</p>
<ul>
<li>“^” means start of the line
<ul>
<li>E.g. ^I think, will find all lines that start with “I think”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“<span class="math inline">\(&quot; means end of the line
- E.g. morning\)</span> finds all lines that end with”morning”</li>
<li>“[]” allows for several characters that would be accepted
<ul>
<li>E.g. “[Bb] [Uu] [Ss] [Hh]” find all lines that have the word “bush”
written, no matter whether the characters are all small letters, capital
letters, or a mix between them. For example, “bush”, “Bush”, and “BUSH”
would all be matched with this expression</li>
<li>You can also include ranges of letters or numbers within the square
brackets
<ul>
<li>E.g. [a-z],[0-9], or [a-zA-Z]</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>“[^]” means do not match
<ul>
<li>E.g. [^?.]$ would be all lines that do not end with ? or .</li>
<li>You can use this to stop a full match if you have a greedy
quantifier and know a character that should not be matched</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“.” means any character
<ul>
<li>E.g. 9.11 could match with “9-11”, “9/11”, and “9211”</li>
<li>The period can also match nothing, like “911”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“|” means or
<ul>
<li>E.g. flood|fire would match any line that contains flood or
fire</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“()” indicates that whatever is before it goes for everything inside
of the parenthesis
<ul>
<li>E.g. ^([Gg]ood|[Bb]ad) means that the line has to start with either
“Good”, “good”, “Bad”, or “bad”. While <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>ood|[Bb]ad would mean
that it has to start with “Good” or “good”, or contain “Bad” or
“bad”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“?” means that the part is optional, but if you have, it can only
happen once. It either has the character before it or nothing, but it
can’t have anything else, and it can’t have anything else following it
<ul>
<li>[Gg]eorge( [Ww].)? [Bb]ush would accept “George W. Bush”, but also
just “George Bush”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“" means you escape the regex meaning of that character
<ul>
<li>[Gg]eorge( [Ww].)? [Bb]ush would mean you are looking for
e.g. “George W. Bush” while just having [Gg]eorge( [Ww].)? [Bb]ush would
mean there could be any character after the W, such as “George WA
Bush”</li>
<li>You can also do this by enclosing the character in square brackets,
e.g. [.] would match a period only</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“*” means repeat any number of times, including 0
<ul>
<li>E.g. (.*) would match with lines containing (), either empty or with
any string of any length</li>
<li>This metacharacter is greedy, meaning that it will match the longest
possible match it can find
<ul>
<li>E.g. ^s(.*)s will match with the whole string in “sitting in
starbucks” and not just the “sitting in s” part, since it wants as much
as possible</li>
<li>You can turn off the greedy function with a “?”, to make it lazy
instead
<ul>
<li>^s(.*?)s$</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>“+” means repeated any number of times, but at least once In
contrast to *, which is any number of times, including zero
<ul>
<li>E.g. (.+) would match () with any string of any length in it, but
not empty</li>
<li>Works on the character immediately to the left of it, such as “s”,
“2” or “”. If you want more to be repeated together, you need to
encompass it in parentheses</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“{}” are interval ranges of how many times something can be repeated
<ul>
<li>E.g. [Bb]ush( +[^ ]+ +){1,5} debate would match with any string that
has “Bush” or “bush”, then between one or five words, then the word
“debate”</li>
<li>You do not have to specify a range, you can also put in only one
number, meaning that it has to be repeated exactly that number of times,
or a number with a comma, meaning it has to be repeated at least the
specified number of times, but with no upper limit
<ul>
<li>E.g. {2} or {3,}</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>“\1” or any other number means find the repeat of what was matched
earlier in the parentheses. The number represents what group to find the
same match as.
<ul>
<li>E.g. (\d\d)\+(\d\d)=\2\+\1 could match 12+65=65+12</li>
<li>+([a-zA-Z]+) +\1 + would match any lines that have two words that
are repeated after each other, such as “one one” or “so so”</li>
<li>You can use this with str_replace to switch the order of characters
in a string</li>
<li>If you need more than 9 back-references (in which you should
probably name them instead), some languages interpret \10 as a
back-reference to 1 with a 0 afterward and other to the group 10. You
can write it as \g{10} to make sure it is interpreted as the category
10</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can name a capture group with (?<NAME>regex)
<ul>
<li>It is a little unclear how to get the backreference, it should be
either \k<NAME> or (?P=NAME). The code to capture the replacement string
is also a little unclear, but could be ${NAME}, \g<NAME>, $+{NAME}, or
it is not possible and you have to use just \1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Capture groups are numbered from left to right, even if they do not
capture anything. Likewise, if you run over a capture group several
times, it will still just have that one number it got originally. If you
capture several matches for one group, it will return the last match
when called upon</li>

<h2>Regex functions in R</h2>
<p>Most of these notes are taken from the bookchapter on <a
href="https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/regular-expressions.html">Regular
Expressions in the R Programming for Data Science book</a>. In addition,
some are also taken from this <a
href="https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/regex-r-regular-expressions-guide">Datacamp
Regex tutorial</a></p>
<p>Here are some of the main R functions used with regex:</p>
<ul>
<li>grep() - Searches for matches with a regex and returns a vector with
the indices for those matches
<ul>
<li>Setting the parameter value = TRUE will return a vector with the
actual string matches instead</li>
<li>Only gives you the index of the whole relevant string, not where the
match is on that string. regexpr() can give you the information of
exactly where the match occur in the matched string</li>
</ul></li>
<li>grepl() - Searches for matches with a regex and returns a vector
with TRUE and FALSE values</li>
<li>regexpr() - Searches for matches with a regex and returns both the
(first) start index of that match and the length of the string that
matches
<ul>
<li>Only gives you the first match of the string. If you want all
matches, you have to use gregexpr()</li>
</ul></li>
<li>gregexpr() - Searches for matches with a regex and returns both the
start index of that match and the length of the string that matches.
Returns all instances of the match, even if one the same string
(i.e. item in the vector)
<ul>
<li>The g here stands for global</li>
</ul></li>
<li>sub() - Searches for matches with a regex and replaces that (first)
match with what you specify
<ul>
<li>Will only replace the first match in a string, if you want to
replace all matches in the string, use gsub()</li>
</ul></li>
<li>gsub() - Searches for matches with a regex and replaces that match
with what you specify</li>
<li>regexec() - Searches for matches with a regex, where part of the
regex is in a parenthesis, and returns both the start character index of
the match and the length of it, as well as the start character index of
the match with the part that is in the parenthesis and the length of
that part
<ul>
<li>E.g. regexec(“
<dd>
[F|f]ound on (.*?)
</dd>
“) would give both the start character index of the”&lt;” that matches
the rest of the expression and the length of the match, in addition to
the first character index of the character starting after “on” and how
long that is.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>regmatches() - Like regexec(), but returns the actual matches of the
string, as well as the part specified in the parenthesis</li>
<li>substr() - If you have the indeces of strings already, you can use
substr() to extract the relevant string by index</li>
</ul>
<div id="tidyverse---stringr" class="section level3">
<h3>Tidyverse - Stringr</h3>
<p>Tidyverse has the library stringr which has a maybe more intuitive
function setup and names. For example, all the functions take the data
as the first argument and the regex as the second argument.</p>
<ul>
<li>str_view() - shows you the string, where the match in your string is
highlighed by being surrounded with &lt;&gt;</li>
<li>str_subset() - like grep(value = TRUE) which return a character
vector with the matches only</li>
<li>str_which() - returns an integer vector giving the position of the
strings that match</li>
<li>str_detect() - like grepl() which returns a TRUE/FALSE vector for
matches
<ul>
<li>You can combine filter and str_detect to filter by a regex
<ul>
<li>E.g. filter(str_detect(name, “x”))</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can also combine summarize or other stat functions with filter
to calculate stats by the regex
<ul>
<li>E.g. mean(str_detect(name, “x”)) will give proportions of names with
an x in it per year</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>str_extract() - like regexpr() and regmatches(), which extracts the
string matches of the output</li>
<li>str_match() - like regexec(), returning a matrix with the
parenthesized sub-expressions
<ul>
<li>First column is first character of match and second is first
character of match with the content in the parenthesis</li>
</ul></li>
<li>str_replace() - like sub(), replacing the first string</li>
<li>str_replace_all() - like gsub, replacing all the strings</li>
<li>str_locate() - like regexpr(), which returns the index of the first
match and the length of the match, for the first match</li>
<li>str_locate_all() - like gregexpr(), which returns the index of the
first match and the length of the match, for all the matches</li>
<li>str_count() - counts the number of matches in each string
<ul>
<li>You can combine this with mutate to e.g. make a new variable
counting the number of vowels in a string</li>
</ul></li>
<li>separete_wider_regex() - take information from one column and
separete it into several columns based on a regex
<ul>
<li>E.g. separate_wider_regex(str, patterns = c(“&lt;”, name =
“[A-Za-z]+”, “&gt;-”, gender = “.”, “_“, age =”[0-9]+“)) will get the
information out of strings like”<Sheryl>-F_34”</li>
<li>If it fails, you can apparently use too_few = “debug”, I don’t know
what it does, but it should be helpful</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div id="optional-parameters" class="section level4">
<h4>Optional parameters</h4>
<ul>
<li>ignore_case = TRUE - the regex will ignore whether the characters
are lower or upper case</li>
<li>dotall = TRUE - lets a . match everything, including a new
line?</li>
<li>multiline = TRUE - matches the start or end of each line instead of
just each string
<ul>
<li>Instead of being lazy based on string, it is lazy based on each new
line</li>
</ul></li>
<li>comments = TRUE - ignores spaces, newlines, and # and everything
following it in your expression. You can therefore add spaces and
comments in the middle of your expresison (with line shifts) to make it
more readable
<ul>
<li>If you then want to match a space, escape it with a backslash</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="special-characters-from-literals" class="section level2">
<h2>Special characters from literals</h2>
<p>You can use a backslash to make normal literals a metacharacter. All
of these should follow a backslahs, but aren’t here as that is
considered formatting in R:</p>
<ul>
<li>w - any word character, including digit, letter, and underscore</li>
<li>W - any non-word character</li>
<li>d - any digit</li>
<li>D - any non-digit</li>
<li>s - any space character, including space, tab, and new line</li>
<li>S - any non-space character</li>
<li>b - a word boundary, such as a space or parenthesis before or after
what is specified in the regex E.g. double backslash and bab matches
“ab” in “abc”, but not “bab”, as that word doesn’t start or end with
“ab”</li>
<li>B - a non-word boundary, such as another character after what is
specified before this E.g. double backslash and Bab matches “ab” in
“dabc”, but not “abc”, as that word starts start (or end) with “ab”</li>
<li>n - a new line</li>
<li>t - a tab</li>
<li>v - a vertical tab</li>
<li>&lt; - beginning of a word</li>
<li><blockquote>
<ul>
<li>end of a word</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li>A - beginning of a string</li>
<li>z or Z - end of a string Depends on programming language</li>
<li>G - beginning of string or end of previous match
<ul>
<li>E.g. if you want to only get the results from Jane on a score board,
you can use the following regex (?:Jane| +:() to get the numbers from
“Tarzan A:33 B:32 C:36 Jane A:35 B:33 C:31”
<ul>
<li>You could also do this will lookbehinds, but G is more
economical</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="inline-modifiers" class="section level2">
<h2>Inline Modifiers</h2>
<p>Modifiers change the mode of the following regex part. You do not to
include the following part in parenthesis</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(?i) - case-insensitive mode</p></li>
<li><p>(?s) - matches across lines</p>
<ul>
<li>Like if everything was on one line</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(?m) - multiline mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, anchors like ^ or $ only match the beginning or end of a
string. If you turn on multiline mode, it will match the end or
beginning of each line instead</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(?x) - free-spacing mode</p>
<ul>
<li>You can write your regex with whitespace and line breaks that are
not interpreted as characters to be matched. This allows for spacing out
the regex to be more readable</li>
<li>E.g. var wordWithDigitAndCapRegex = new Regex( @“(?x) # Free-spacing
mode</li>
</ul>
<p>^ # Assert that position = beginning of string</p>
<p id="lookahead" class="heading">Lookahead</p>

<div id="lookarounds" class="section level2">
<h2>Lookarounds</h2>
<p>Lookarounds will look for the match you specify, either before or
after the match (based on your expression). It will only match if the
lookaround condition is met, but it will not actually capture the part
in the lookaround. Lookahead or lookbehind refers to which direction it
is looking in. The reason it doesn’t capture anything is that it is like
it hasn’t moved further in reading the string when reaching a
lookaround, is stays stagnant, looks ahead or behind (without moving)
and then it starts moving when it gets to the code past the
lookaround</p>
<ul>
<li>(?=) - Positive lookahead
<ul>
<li>E.g. if you have (?=\d{10})\d{5}, it is similar as saying, if there
are 10 digits here, match the first 5 of them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(?&lt;=) - Positive lookbehind
<ul>
<li>E.g. if you have (?&lt;=\d)cat, it is simlar as saying if there is a
number before “cat”, match with “cat”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(?!) - Negative lookahead
<ul>
<li>E.g. if you have (?!theatre)the+, it is simlar to saying if the word
isn’t preeceded by “theatre”, match “the” and any letter after it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(?&lt;!) - Negative lookbehind
<ul>
<li>E.g. if you have (?&lt;!mon)ster, it is the same as saying if you
have three letters, that are not “mon”, and the “ster”, match those
three letters and “ster”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you test multiple conditions, you can usually use n-1
lookarounds, where n is the number of conditions you have. This is
because you need to capture something too, so the last condition can be
a capture group instead of a lookaround.</li>
<li>Also be aware, if you test multiple conditions, that since the
lookahead doesn’t move, if you have two lookaheads, they will start from
the same position, not subsequent positions.</li>
<li>When you decide on whether you should use a lookahead or lookbehind,
see what would require matching the fewest characters. There is usually
one position that is more efficient than the other.</li>
<li>You can nest lookarounds, for example this regex
\d+(?=<em>(?!</em>)) to find numbers that is followed by one, but not
more than one underscore.</li>
<li>It is often good practice to anchor lookarounds, as that makes them
fail or succeed immediately, instead of running through the whole
string, as long as that is not what we want to do</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="other-more-advanced-stuff" class="section level2">
<h2>Other more advanced stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li>(?:) - a non-capture group, so that you do not capture what is
inside of the group</li>
<li>[[:&lt;:]] - beginning of word boundary. Only match if at the
beginning of a word. Nothing can come before it, the word starts with
what has been provided
<ul>
<li>E.g. [[:&lt;:]]cat matches cat and catfish, but not tomcat</li>
<li>Similar to ?=)?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[[:&gt;:]] - end of word boundary, nothing can come after it, the
word stops there
<ul>
<li>E.g. cat[[:&gt;:]] matches cat and tomcat, but not catfish</li>
<li>Similar to ?&lt;=)?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a difference between delimiters and boundaries. Boundaries
look at whether there is a difference between what comes before and
after the relevant part. A lookaround will only look in one direction.
You can however use both a lookahead and lookbehind to detect
boundaries.</p>
<p>If you make a boundary yourself, you can define it and then later
call it by that name. For example:</p>
<p>(?x) # free-spacing mode (?(DEFINE) # Define some subroutines (?<A1>
# Define “A1” boundary # This boundary matches when # one side is a
letter and # the other is a number
(?i)(?&lt;=^|\d)(?=[a-z])|(?&lt;=[a-z])(?=$|\d) ) # End A1 definition )
# End DEFINE</p>
<p>The actual regex matching starts here We can use our “A1” boundary
wherever we like (?&amp;A1)cat(?&amp;A1)</p>
</div>
<div id="quantifiers" class="section level2">
<h2>Quantifiers</h2>
<ul>
<li>For example +</li>
<li>All quantifiers are by default greedy, meaning that they will match
as much as possible
<ul>
<li>For example, using on 123 will match 123, not 1 or 12</li>
<li>The quantifier is also docile, meaning that it will give back parts
if needed to match the rest of the string</li>
<li>For example, if you use A+. to match on AAA, the A+ will first match
all of AAA, then the . will fail to match anything. Therefore, the A+
part gives up one A, so that it can match with . Ultimately, the A+
therefore matches AA and the . matches A
<ul>
<li>If you instead have A+.., the A+ will match the first A and each .
will match each own A.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Similarly, if you have the regex .*apple and the string A tasty
apple, the . will first match everything, then backtrack when apple
isn’t matched, until it can match it. The ultimate result will therefore
be that the . takes “A tasty” and the apple part matches with
“apple”.</li>
<li>The fact that it is greedy does not mean that it matches the longest
match whenever in the string, but that it matches as much as possible
from the first possible match
<ul>
<li>E.g. if you have 12 9999 and use it will match 12 and not 9999, even
though it is greedy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can add a ? to a quantifier to make it lazy, so it matches as
few characters as possible for the match to occur</li>
<li>The quantifier ? matches with none or one match
<ul>
<li>For example, the match ?E will match with 123E in the string 123EEE,
not with all of it, because the ? only need to match with 123 to get an
E afterward, not all of 123EE</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lazy quantifiers match with as little as possible
<ul>
<li>Most lazy quantifiers are also helpful, meaning that it originally
starts the match with the smallest possible match, then expands until
the whole string matches
<ul>
<li>E.g. in our ??E example, it starts matching nothing, since ? can be
nothing, but then fails to match the E. Therefore, it tries adding 1,
but still fails. Only after adding 123 does it succeed with a whole
match, as the next character is E. This is lazy, but helpful
behavior</li>
<li>The lazy quantifier matches the smallest possible match from the
starting point, not for the entire string</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can make a quantifier possessive by adding a + to it. This
negates the docile behavior for greedy quantifiers
<ul>
<li>E.g. A+. will match the string AAA, but A++. won’t, as all A’s are
taken up with the “A++” part, so that there is nothing left for the
.</li>
<li>Sometimes, you can make a quantifier possessive if you know that it
won’t matter, especially if your match might fail. This will speed up
the code, since it doesn’t have to constantly back-track</li>
<li>Some engines, like R, looks at the string before starting and
automatically makes a regex part possessive if this doesn’t affect the
matching, to make the code faster.
<ul>
<li>This can be turned off with (*NO_AUTO_POSSESS)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The process of the engine going back when a pattern fails to see
whether making other choices (e.g. matching fewer characters with a +)
would lead to a match is called backtracking
<ul>
<li>Can help you catch more matches, but can also lead to the code
running for a long time as the engine keeps backtracking to try all
variations of how the regex can be applied to a match to see whether any
of them will lead to a match</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are some quantifiers that can lead to a lot of backtracking,
called explosive quantifiers
<ul>
<li>These includes *, +, {x, }, or a specified range with a high number,
like 10 or more</li>
<li>This can especially happen if you have two quantifiers in different
places that can lead to an exponential number of possible variations
<ul>
<li>E.g. (A+)*</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another way of looking at this is to use contrast in your regex
patterns. If you have a lot of parts of the regex that can fit multiple
parts of the string, there will be many variations, while if you have
more specific expressions, there will be less backtracking since there
are fewer variations</li>
<li>You can use atomic groups to counteract this
<ul>
<li>Put a regex expression inside of (?&gt;) to make the group
atomic</li>
<li>Then, after the engine runs through the group, it cannot backtrack
to try other variations</li>
<li>Atomic groups with one character and a quantifier is often the same
as a possessive quantifier
<ul>
<li>E.g. (?&gt;A+) is equal to A++, (?&gt;A<em>) is equal to A</em>+,
and (?&gt;A?) is equivalent to A?+</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Generally, be as specific and concise as you can in your patterns to
decrease backtracking
<ul>
<li>E.g. not (A|AA)+, but A+</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>+, ?, and * are all greedy, but docile, matching one or more, zero
or one, and zero or more parts of a string
<ul>
<li>Add + do either of these to make it greedy and possessive, so that
it won’t backtrack to make the match work</li>
<li>Add ? to either of these to make them lazy, so that they match to as
few matches as possible. All of these lazy matches are still helpful, so
it will be lazy by default, but take more if needed</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="conditionals" class="section level2">
<h2>Conditionals</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can add conditionals with the following syntax: (?(A)X|Y)
<ul>
<li>This statement says that if A is TRUE, then you do X. If not, do
Y</li>
<li>(?(A)X) means if A, do X
<ul>
<li>No else statement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(?(A)|X) means if not A, do X. If A, match empty string</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can force a regex to fail if it has a specific condition
<ul>
<li>E.g. Lets say that you want to match two possible combinations of
words. Consider an ID system where you have a lot of IDs, followed by a
status of either pending or active. However, some of the IDs are
temporary, designated with the IDs beginning with TMP. These temporary
IDs can only be active, not pending. Therefore, we will make a regex
that can capture all of the valid IDs, but ignore the unvalid cases
(temporary IDs that are pending). The regex
^(TMP)?_(?:active|pending(?(1)(?!)))$. This code will capture “TMP” as
an optional capture group, then some numbers, an underscore, and either
the status pending or active. If it catches active, everything is fine.
However, if it captures pending, and the first capture group is matched
(meaning the string starts with “TMP”), then the match will
automatically fail because of the (?!)
<ul>
<li>This example was developed in co-junction with ChatGPT</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can also fail with an if-else-then statement
<ul>
<li>E.g. ^(TMP)?_(?:active|pending(?(1)|(?!)))$. In this code, there is
either an active status, or whether there is a pending status and a
“TMP” start string (i.e. the capture group has been set). If this is not
the case, then it fails.
<ul>
<li>This is an opposite condition for the TMP and pending scenario as
with only the if-else statement</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="recursive-regexs" class="section level2">
<h2>Recursive regexs</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can add (?R) to repeat a pattern a selected number of times,
instead of writing it all out.
<ul>
<li>E.g. (?R)? to match “aaa111bbb222”
<ul>
<li>You could alternatively use the regex “(?:)+”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can add a conditional to the expression
<ul>
<li>E.g. Match a repeat of the word until the end of the string with
“abc(?:$|(?R))”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can use these recursive regex to match more complicated
patterns, like palindromes
<ul>
<li>E.g. ()(?:(?R)|?)\1
<ul>
<li>I haven’t fully parsed how this regex works, but it is something to
look into for more complicated expressions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="backtracking-control-verbs" class="section level2">
<h2>Backtracking Control Verbs</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can use backtracking control verbs to change what the engine
does during a backtrack
<ul>
<li>The verbs will therefore not have any effect on the code (i.e be
skipped) when matching and only have an effect if the regex needs to
backtrack the matching</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are many control verbs:
<ul>
<li>(*THEN) - Used with a conditional expression. Stops the match and
moves on to the next possible condition (other side of |)
<ul>
<li>E.g. “Comedian: (?:B+ (<em>THEN)Murray|E+ (</em>THEN)Murphy|P+
Sellers)” to match the name of a comedian in a string. The (*THEN) makes
it so that the expression does not backtrack if the last name is not the
right one, given the first letter of the first name</li>
<li>In most situations you wouldn’t really need the (<em>THEN), but if
you were to have a very long string before the (</em>THEN) statement, it
could speed up the expression by getting rid of the backtracking. In
this scenario, you could write it as “Comedian: (?:B+ Murray|E+
Murphy|P+ Sellers)” since the string isn’t that long anyway</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(*PRUNE) - Stops the match if it tries to backtrack past the
expression</li>
<li>(*SKIP)</li>
<li>(*COMMIT)</li>
</ul></li>
