<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Tidyverse</h1>

</div>


<p>So, I started this project with a goal of looking into Tidyverse. I
learned to program in Python first and then R and I am mostly used to
using base R and not Tidyverse. However, I know that a lot of people
think that Tidyverse is a lot better. So my goal starting this project
was to contrast and compare Tidyverse and base R and the come to a
conclusion regarding which seemed to be the most helpful and when.
However, I ended up going in a little more informal direction. As I
learned more about the basics of Tidyverse, I started trying to use it
more to learn more about it and ended up really liking it in the end. It
is a little different than base R and Python as I was thaugt it, but if
you know how to use it, it can really speed up coding and making the
output easier to interpret. There are still plenty of cases in which the
Tidyverse solutions aren’t flexible enough and I have had to revert to
using base R, but now I always google whether there is a function for
something in Tidyverse before starting writing a complicated and often
vectorized function in base R. Most often than not, there has been a
function for it in Tidyverse. I think most of the work I have done has
been behind the scenes when working on the applied projects (projects 7,
8, and 9), where I have progressively (altough this is not reflected in
the progression of the projects, but instead the time of when I worked
on the projects) used more and more Tidyverse solutions instead of
solutions in base R.</p>
<p>I have therefore now switch to using Tidyverse by default wherever I
can and rather fall back on base R when that is needed. I still think
that base R is useful because it offers a lot more flexibility than
Tidyverse. However, Tidyverse is improving fast and has had a solution
for most of the scenarios I have been in. The following section will go
over some of the notes and reflections I have made about Tidyverse so
that I can come back for reference later. However, this is fairly rough,
as most of the learning have happened through playing around with
Tidyverse solutions when working on my applied projects. Those projects
might therefore be a better metric of what I have learned about
Tidyverse than this section. I am anyway eager to share the notes that I
do have so far and to brainstorm further challenges, considerations, and
opportunities in Tidyverse to look further into later. I deleted the
sections I originally had about Tidyverse vs base R as they were
intended to let me compare and contrast when to use each. This isn’t
necessary anymore since my default has become to use Tidyverse until
that doesn’t seem to offer enough flexibility and then switch to base
R.</p>
<p>Unless noted otherwise, this information comes from the course notes,
trying and failing, and the help pages.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="general-tidyverse-notes" class="section level1">
<h1>General Tidyverse Notes</h1>
<p>Tidyverse has gotten a lot of attention when it comes to data science
and I have mostly encountered it through Pandas in Python and how there
is some controversy around it as Pandas is based on R. However, it seems
to have a lot of really useful functions that speed up writing the code
and makes things a lot easier to read.</p>
<p>Tidyverse is considered an universe of libraries. Some libraries are
considered part of the core of Tidyverse. These are the libraries that
get loaded automatically when you load the Tidyverse library. These
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ggplot2 - Creating flexible graphs</li>
<li>dplyr - Easy data wrangling and manipulation</li>
<li>tidyr - Functions for wrangling tibbles and and data frames, such as
pivoting</li>
<li>readr - Reads in data into R from other file formats</li>
<li>purrr - Functions for vectorized operations without using loops</li>
<li>tibble - Type of data frame that is more user-friendly</li>
<li>stringr - Functions to manipulate strings and text</li>
<li>forcats - Functions to manipulate factors</li>
<li>lubridate - functions to manipulate dates and time in R</li>
</ul>
<p>As you will see, I have mostly used dplyr and ggplot2 in the code for
this portfolio.</p>
<p>In addition, there are other libraries that from the Tidyverse
universe that you can load separately, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>broom - Summarizes data from models into a tibble
<ul>
<li>Has three functions, tidy(), glance(), and augment()</li>
<li>What you use with Tyidymodels to get quick and clear output from
your models</li>
</ul></li>
<li>cli - Color palettes</li>
<li>conflicted - Throws you an error if you are using a function that
exists in multiple loaded packages, so that you have to specify which
package to get the function from. Reduces the chance of using the wrong
function due to conflicting functions</li>
<li>dbplyr - dplyr for data bases
<ul>
<li>Allows you to use remote data bases as if they were loaded into your
memory</li>
</ul></li>
<li>dtplyr - Backend for data tables
<ul>
<li>Allow you to write dplyr code, but have it automatically be
translated into code that works on data tables. This can be desirable as
data tables are faster than tibbles</li>
</ul></li>
<li>glue - Add placeholders for variables in text and print it easily
<ul>
<li>E.g. Write emails that adds the name from a variable of each
person</li>
</ul></li>
<li>googledrive - Allows you to interact with Google Drive through R
<ul>
<li>You can get files, get the drive, edits files, share them, and so
on</li>
</ul></li>
<li>googlesheets4 - Allows you to create and edits Google sheets from
R</li>
<li>haven - Read and write data to and from SPSS, Stata, and SAS
files</li>
<li>hms - Adds a class for storing time in hh:mm:ss format</li>
<li>httr - Design and process HTTP requests, tailored towards APIs
<ul>
<li>There is an updated version called httr2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>jsonlite - Work with JSON in R</li>
<li>magrittr - Allows for piping for more readable code</li>
<li>modelr - Used to create more user-friendly models
<ul>
<li>Tidymodels are best practices in the Tidyverse currently, not
modelr</li>
</ul></li>
<li>pillar - Styling the display/output of data</li>
<li>ragg - Provides graphics to R (e.g. ggplot)</li>
<li>readxl - Get data from Excel to R efficiently</li>
<li>reprex - Prep reprex (reproducible example) for quick reference,
e.g. when asking for help from others online</li>
<li>rlang - Some automatic behind the scene stuff and interpolation with
{{}}?</li>
<li>rstudioapi - Use APIs easier through R</li>
<li>rvest - Scrapte data from webpages
<ul>
<li>Static, but not dynamic webpages</li>
</ul></li>
<li>xml2 - Work with xml and html (mark-up languages) efficiently</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are also Tidymodels. As of now, I think other
individual packages for the various statistical methods work better. But
Tidymodels might be more useful in a few years, so I might come back to
evaluate it then. However, as of now, I do not use Tidymodels. There are
several libraries in Tidymodels that are a part of the core, including
tidymodels, rsample, parsnip, recipes, workflows, tune, yardstick,
broom, dials. See the <a
href="https://www.tidymodels.org/packages/">Tidymodels webpage</a> for
more information.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="magrittr" class="section level1">
<h1>Magrittr</h1>
<p>The first library I want to discuss is magrittr, which gets
automatically loaded with any Tidyverse library. It contains the pipe
%&gt;% that allows you to write clearer code with more white space,
instead of in a lot of nested parentheses. For example, I have the
following code in project 7: Data wrangling: <br> “data_df_long %&gt;%
<br> select(ext_scale_f, ext_scale_m, ext_scale_c, Age_int) %&gt;% <br>
pivot_longer(cols = c(ext_scale_f, ext_scale_m, ext_scale_c), names_to
=”rater”, values_to = “rating”) %&gt;% <br> mutate( <br> rater =
case_when( <br> rater == “ext_scale_f” ~ “Father”, <br> rater ==
“ext_scale_m” ~ “Mother”, <br> rater == “ext_scale_c” ~ “Child” <br> ))
%&gt;% <br> filter(!is.na(rating)) %&gt;% <br> group_by(rater, Age_int)
%&gt;% count()” <br></p>
<p>If I were to write this without piping, I would have to write it as:
“count(group_by(filter(mutate(pivot_longer(select(data_df_long,
ext_scale_f, ext_scale_m, ext_scale_c, Age_int), cols = c(ext_scale_f,
ext_scale_m, ext_scale_c), names_to =”rater”, values_to = “rating”),
<br> rater = case_when( <br> rater == “ext_scale_f” ~ “Father”, <br>
rater == “ext_scale_m” ~ “Mother”, <br> rater == “ext_scale_c” ~ “Child”
<br> )), !is.na(rating)), rater, Age_int))” <br></p>
<p>As you can see, this second block of code is much harder to read,
because there is so much going on and all of the functions are nested in
each other, so to read it in the way in which things happen, you have to
start innermost in the parentheses and work your way outwards, which is
not intuitive. The magrittr solution does on the other hand have a lot
of space to clearly separate each step and every sub-step is coded in
the order they occur. You can therefore read the magrittr code from left
to right, top to bottom, like when reading normal text. I will mention
that the code block of what it would look like without magrittr would
probably not be done in one single block without magrittr, but would
probably instead be divided into separate substeps that were saved as
midaries before going to the next step. This can quickly clutter up the
environment and cause conflicts from overwriting pre-existing variables
if one is not careful.</p>
<p>The way the piping works is that it does an action, then it takes the
output of that action and pipes it in as the first parameter in the next
function, and so on. This works with the Tidyverse functions and
libraries because they always have the object acted upon as there first
parameter (e.g. data frame, tibble, vector, string). However, this is
not always the case with base R, so be careful with mixing Tidyverse and
base R code. There are some workarounds though, such as using . as a
placeholder for the parameter. For example you might have a lot of code
and then want to pipe it into a plot, which you can do with e.g. z
%&gt;% f(x, y, arg = .). I found some uses of this when playing around
with vectorized operations from base R that was mixed in with dplyr
functions. It is possible that purrr would have been a better option,
but this does also work.</p>
<p>The pipe in magrittr is typically written as “%&gt;%”, but you can
also write it as “|&gt;”. Alternatively, you can also use the shortcut
Ctrl + shift + m to get the pipe.</p>
<p>Magrittr also has some additional pipes that have special meanings.
These aren’t used as much, but can be good to know about:</p>
<ul>
<li>%T&gt;% - Returns the left-hand side output instead of the
right-hand, like %&gt;% does
<ul>
<li>E.g. you can use it in the following code to both plot the data and
calculate the sums of columns. If you have used a normal pipe before
plot, it would have returned the plot, which is emtpy. Instead, you run
the code through plot(), which creates a plot, but uses %T&gt;% to
indicate that you want to pipe the output from matrix(ncol = 2) and not
plot(), into colSums.
<ul>
<li>“rnorm(200) %&gt;% <br> matrix(ncol = 2) %T&gt;% <br> plot() %&gt;%
# plot usually does not return anything. <br> colSums()</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>%!&gt;% - Makes the piped expression eager (as opposed to %&gt;%
which is lazy) and evaluates the piped input at each step. This seems to
mostly be useful if you have output that occurs at each step, such as
printing a message</li>
<li>%$% - Separates the variables in a data frame so that you can call
them individually
<ul>
<li>You can’t run the code <br> “mtcars %&gt;% <br> cor(disp, mpg)” as
this would be equivalent to running <br> “cor(mtcars, disp, mpg)” which
has too many arguments. <br> Instead you can run <br> “mtcars %$% <br>
cor(disp, mpg)” which takes the data frame mtcars and separates it for
each variable, then chooses the variables disp and mpg when they are
referred to</li>
</ul></li>
<li>%&lt;&gt;% works as a pipe, but also saves the output in the
original variable
<ul>
<li>E.g. you can run <br> “mtcars %&lt;&gt;% transform(cyl = cyl * 2)”
instead of <br> “mtcars &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% <br> transform(cyl = cyl *
2)”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The section with different types of pipes was in part taken from the
<a
href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html#other-tools-from-magrittr">r2ds
textbook</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="tidyselect" class="section level1">
<h1>Tidyselect</h1>
<p>Tidyselect is another one of those libraries that get loaded
automatically by any library that uses it in the background like
magrittr. It contains selecting helpers that can be used within other
functions in Tidyverse to select specific columns in a data frame or
tibble.</p>
<p>The following are some of the selector helpers in Tidyselect:</p>
<ul>
<li>starts_with() - Starts with a specific prefix</li>
<li>ends_with() - Ends with a specific prefix</li>
<li>contains() - Contains a specific string(s) or character(s)</li>
<li>matches() - Matches a regex</li>
<li>num_range() - Matches a numerical range
<ul>
<li>You can even add a prefix as a parameter and then e.g. find all
variables from x1 - x10, excluding any variables with a higher number,
such as x11, x12, and x13
<ul>
<li>The code for this would be “data %&gt;% select(num_range(”x”,
1:10))”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>all_of() - Takes all of the names or matches in a vector. If some
are not present, you get an error</li>
<li>any_of() - Takes all of the names or matches in a vector. If some
are not present, these will just be ignored</li>
<li>everything() - Matches all of the variables
<ul>
<li>Tidyverse functions sometimes get fuzzy if you just give them a
whole data frame, instead they seem to prefer to get have the
eveything() selector helper to indicate that you do indeed want all of
the columns. Sometimes adding everything() to a function has gotten me
past errors</li>
</ul></li>
<li>last_col() - Choosing the last column
<ul>
<li>You can add an offset to this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>where() - Selects the variables for which the expression returns
TRUE
<ul>
<li>E.g. “iris %&gt;% select(where(is.factor))”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>group_cols() - Selecting all columns the data set are currently
grouped by</li>
</ul>
<p>These selector helpers are very powerful in combination with dplyr
functions, such as select()</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="rlang" class="section level1">
<h1>Rlang</h1>
<p>rlang is a library that gets loaded automatically and has more
under-the-hood functions that works with Tidyverse. I have seen examples
of solutions using rlang concepts when looking into more complicated
vectorized operations in Tidyverse, as an alternative of using base R
(e.g. piping into an argument that is not the first and calling dynamic
column names).</p>
<p>When working with base R and columns, one has to add quotation marks
around the columns to indicate that it is a column name and not a
variable. If you want to subset some columns from a data frame, you
would write <br> “subset(df, select = (”col_1”, “col_2”, “col_3”))” <br>
<br> Tidyverse does on the other hand just assume that you are going to
supply a column name when you are piping in a data frame, so it adds the
quotation marks automatically (behind the hood), so that you do not have
to do it yourself. You can therefore write the base R code above in
Tidyverse as <br> “df %&gt;% <br> select(col_1, col_2, col_3)” <br> <br>
This is usually nice and does what you want. However, it becomes a
problem if you are trying to refer to a dynamic variable (e.g. with a
column name) rather than the column itself. Tidyverse will then add
quotation marks around the variable name behind the hood and look for a
column with that variable name. If it can’t find it it will throw an
error, even if the variable is assigned to a string that corresponds to
a column name.</p>
<p>One way of telling Tidyverse to actually evaluate the string (or
unquote it) is to add “!!” before the variable.</p>
<p>If you use !! on both sides of an equal sign, you have to switch it
out with “:=”. This works the same functionally as “=”</p>
<p>There is also “!!!” that evaluates the expression and unpacks it, for
example a vector</p>
<p>There is some more theory to it, that I haven’t gotten fully into
yet. However, the following information was based on these two pages: <a
href="https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/tidy-eval-detailed.html">Tidy
eval</a> and <a
href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/evaluation.html#tidy-evaluation">Tidy
evaluation</a> and you can refer to them for more in-depth introductions
to rlang and its evaluators</p>
<p>rlang also interprets shortcuts as functions. For example, “~” is
interpreted to mean “function()” automatically by rlang’s as_function()
function. You can therefore write “~ .x + 5” instead of “function(x) x +
5”. When using the tilde, the as_function() in rlang has some default
names for the parameters that you can use to refer to the right one. As
with magrittr, “.” is the same as the first parameter. The same is the
case for “.x”. The second parameter can be called by “.y”. There are no
more than two possible parameters for using this short hand for
functions. <a

<div id="dplyr" class="section level1">
<h1>Dplyr</h1>
<p>Dplyr is probably the Tidyverse library I have used the most and
enjoyed the most, as it has a lot of functions that really speed up
dealing with data. In general, the first argument of any dplyr functions
are always a data frame or tibble. It cannot act upon matrices or
vectors.</p>

<div id="subsetting-data-frames" class="section level3">
<h3>Subsetting data frames</h3>
<ul>
<li>select() - Select specific columns that you want to subset
<ul>
<li>If you want multiple columns, just add them as more parameters</li>
</ul></li>
<li>filter() - Filter the data set for rows only fulfilling certain
criteria</li>
<li>distinct() - Filter the data set for unique rows</li>
<li>slice() - Pick rows using index</li>
<li>slice_sample() - Slice a random sample based on desired sample
size</li>
<li>pull() - Extract a column as a vector</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="organizing-data-frames" class="section level3">
<h3>Organizing data frames</h3>
<ul>
<li>relocate() - Change the order of columns in a df</li>
<li>rename() - Rename a column
<ul>
<li>New name = old name as each parameter</li>
</ul></li>
<li>arrange() - Reorder rows ascending
<ul>
<li>Add desc() as a parameter to make it descending</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="manipulating-the-data-frame" class="section level3">
<h3>Manipulating the data frame</h3>
<ul>
<li>mutate() - add a new variable
<ul>
<li>E.g. mutate( <br> number_of_cats = case_when( <br> name == “Ginger
Clark” ~ “2”, <br> name == “Doug Bass” ~ “3”, <br> TRUE ~ number_of_cats
<br> ), <br> number_of_cats = as.numeric(number_of_cats) <br> )
<br></li>
<li>Mutate can take a lot of helper functions as parameters
<ul>
<li>The most commonly used one is case_when() which offers conditions so
that you assign specific values to a variable based on some
condition</li>
<li>Also has if_else(), na_if(), pmax(), pmin(), and other functions for
offsetting values, aggregating values, ranking, and other math
options</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>add_row() - Add a row</li>
<li>rownames_to_column() - Make rownames a separate column that contains
the names
<ul>
<li>Tibbles don’t support rownames, but they sometimes come with
imported data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>column_to_rownames() - Make a column the rownames
<ul>
<li>Useful if you are exporting the data to a file format or object
supporting row names</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="combining-data-frames" class="section level3">
<h3>Combining data frames</h3>
<ul>
<li>bind_cols() - Add columns
<ul>
<li>Join functions are generally considered better practice than
bind_cols(), as it offers more choices</li>
</ul></li>
<li>bind_rows() - Add rows together</li>
<li>union() - Add rows together, but excludes common rows</li>
<li>union_all() - Add rows together and includes common rows</li>
<li>intersect() - Gets all rows that are common</li>
<li>setdiff() - Gets all rows in the first data frame that aren’t in the
second data frame</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="joining-data-frames" class="section level3">
<h3>Joining data frames</h3>
<ul>
<li>left_join() - Take everything that matches with x in y and also
include anything left over from x</li>
<li>right_join() - Take everything that matches with y in x and also
include anything left over from y</li>
<li>full_join() - Take everything from all data frames</li>
<li>semi_join() - Only combine the rows that are common for both data
frame x andy, but you only keep values from x. Essentially, it is like
filtering data frame x to only keep the rows that is shared with y, but
nothing is really combined from y</li>
<li>inner_join() - Just combine what rows are in common in both data
frame x and y</li>
<li>anti_join() - Only keep what is different between data frame x and
y</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="calculating-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>Calculating statistics</h3>
<ul>
<li>summarize() - Calculate summary statistics from a column
<ul>
<li>You add the specific statistic you want as a function and give the
result a name
<ul>
<li>Takes first(), last(), nth(), n(), n_distinct(), sum(), min(),
max(), quantile(), mean(), sd(), var(), and median()
<ul>
<li>E.g. “data %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean())”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also has conditional related functions, such as summarize_if(),
summarize_at() (for specific variables), and summarize_all()</li>
</ul></li>
<li>count() - Count the number of instances of each value</li>
<li>add_count() - Counts the number of instances of each value and adds
it as a column
<ul>
<li>Each count will then be repeated for each row with that value</li>
</ul></li>
<li>n_distinct() - Counts number of distinct instances</li>
</ul>

<div id="other-useful-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Other Useful Functions</h3>
<ul>
<li>names() - Show all the variable names of the data set</li>
<li>glimpse() - Show all the variable names and the first few objects
per column</li>
<li>group_by() - Grouping operations by a value in a variable
<ul>
<li>E.g. calculating a statistics per group</li>
<li>Similar to split file in SPSS</li>
<li>You can group by several variables by adding paramteres. This gives
you each combination of multiple variables</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ungroup() - Ungrouping the data frame, so that the rest of the
calcualtions are done on the whole data frame and not by group
<ul>
<li>Good practice to always ungroup after using group_by</li>
</ul></li>
<li>rowwise() - Perform an action per row (instead of per column, which
is usually the default)
<ul>
<li>Allows you to vectorize functions that aren’t naturally
vectorized</li>
</ul></li>
<li>across() - Indicate that an action should be done for multiple
columns and not just one
<ul>
<li>Is often used together with selector helpers, such as
everything()</li>
</ul></li>

<div id="tidyr" class="section level1">
<h1>Tidyr</h1>
<p>I haven’t used this as much. However, I am familiar with the
following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>pivot_longer() - Wide to long conversion of the data frame</li>
<li>pivot_wider() - Long to wide conversion of the data frame</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks like it also has functions to deal with splitting cells,
expanding tables, handling missing values, and handling nested data</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="purrr" class="section level1">
<h1>Purrr</h1>
<p>Has a lot of functions for vectorized operations. The most common one
is map() where a function is applied to each element in a list and
returns a list. There is also map2() which iterates over two arguments
at a time</p>
<p>There are a lot of other map functions, such as map_dfr() and
map_df(). These are all superseded, meaning that it is considered best
practices to use other functions. In this case, that would be map() and
map2(), potentially also with list_rbind() and list_cbind().</p>
<p>It has a lot of data wrangling and vectorized operations options, but
I haven’t gotten myself familiar with it. It looks like it would be
useful as it would allow for combining creating new vectorized functions
and dplyr, instead of having to combine Tidyverse and base R with the
apply() family.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="forcats" class="section level1">
<h1>Forcats</h1>
<p>Forcats has a lot of quick functions about factors that I have tended
to stumble over while googling something specific that I have needed.
Here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>factor() - Converts a column/variable to a factor</li>
<li>levels() - Returns the levels of a factor</li>
<li>fct_relevel() - Relevel the levels in the factor manually
<ul>
<li>There are plenty of function variations that do this automatically
after certain conditions too</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are more specific functions to alter the factors,
such as changing the values of the levels, combining factors, and adding
or dropping levels. If you are working with factors, it might be worth a
quick glance over the <a

<div id="readr" class="section level1">
<h1>Readr</h1>
<p>readr offers a lot more choices when importing files, so you can
import files with less data cleaning afterward, which is often the case
when doing so with base R. See the <a
href="https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-import.pdf">Readr
Cheatsheet</a> for reference.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="stringr" class="section level1">
<h1>Stringr</h1>
<p>Stringr has a lot of functions that help find or replace strings. I
have never gotten that into it, because I know how to use Regex. It
seems easier to make a regex expression than to always find the one
specific function to use. However, I am sure there are some helpful
functions that could speed up my programming here too. If interested,
here is the <a

<div id="lubridate" class="section level1">
<h1>Lubridate</h1>
<p>If you are doing anything that uses dates or times, lubridate will
probably be very helpful. It can easily reformat times, use math to
substract or add days, years, or time, round time and dates, and deal
with time zones. Refer to the <a
href="https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/lubridate.pdf">Lubridate
Cheatsheet</a> for the most common functions.</p>

<div id="reflection" class="section level1">
<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>Learning about Tidyverse has almost been like learning a separate
programming language at times. However, it has been really useful and I
think that the projects I have that have used Tidyverse codes are much
easier to read and understand and the code is also a lot shorter, which
means it can be written faster. I am looking forward to expanding my
knowledge and expertise in Tidyverse in the future, as I always find new
and exciting functions when looking into Tidyverse. I am especially
interested in learning more about rlang and other helper functions, that
offers more of the flexibility that base R does when the standard
Tidyverse set-up is too specific. As I mentioned in the beginning, I
have always been a base R user before starting this course, but working
with Tidyverse has gotten me over to using Tidyverse as a default. The
more I use it and learn from it, the more I learn how to access some of
the (lesser knows) features that offers a flexibility similar to that of
base R. I can only imagine that there will be more and more of these as
time go by.</p>
<p>There are still a few more things I would like to look into with
Tidyverse in the future, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try out some of the Tidymodels libraries that seem interesting,
especially recipies, workflows, and rsample</li>
<li>Add more code and examples to demonstrate the Tidyverse
functions</li>
<li>Learn more about rlang, as I have seen several of its symbols come
up when trying to write more complicated vectorized functions.
Especially when it becomes a mix between Tidyverse and base R code.</li>
<li>Learn more about purrr and using it as an alternative to base R’s
vectorized operations</li>
<li>Learn about other, maybe lesser-known, Tidyverse libraries and
functions</li>
</ul>
