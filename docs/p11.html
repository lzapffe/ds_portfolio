<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Making a lab 0</h1>

</div>


<p>I made this lab instead of doing another lab from the course myself.
When choosing what lab to make, I wanted to do a lab 0, since I remember
helping a lot of students who were confused with all of the set-up and
initial stages of the course. I also remember finding the beginning a
little confusing myself, since there were several new components and it
can be hard to keep track of all the different things that have to be
done and all the different programs (e.g. R, Rstudio, GitHub, GitHub
Desktop). I have therefore created this lab that will take the students
to the basics of the course, how to use R and Rstudio, how to use GitHub
and GitHub Desktop, and set up the class with a contract, initialing the
portfolio webpage, and handing in their first lab. The hope is that this
will make it easier for the students to get started with the course,
because they get a direct introduction to R and Rstudio, GitHub and
GitHub Desktop, get the main assignments and their repositories set up,
and also get some basic practice with creating R markdown documents,
creating and cloning repositories, knitting documents, pushing changes
to their remote repositories, and handing in assignments by creating
issues. It also has everything in one place, so that it will hopefully
be easier to not get confused about what to do where and not miss out on
an important step.</p>
<p>I think that implementing this lab would require changing both module
0 and 1 and instead have a module that is just plain onboarding
activities and getting started. The next module, module 1, can then
start directly on R programming since the students already know some of
the basics of the programs we are using and have gotten started with the
course.</p>
<p>I have made the lab with the following considerations in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have tried to remove all the technical language that isn’t
essential for the students and which might make them feel overwhelmed
when there are already so many new things. For example, the page that
guides the students through installing R says “Install R, a free
software environment for statistical computing and graphics from CRAN,
the Comprehensive R Archive Network. I highly recommend you install a
precompiled binary distribution for your operating system – use the
links up at the top of the CRAN page linked above!”. I have tried to not
introduce any more terms than necessary and guide the students through
all the steps, so that they can get a little more confident in their
skills before exposing them to things like CRAN.</li>
<li>I have tried to put everything the student will need to know and get
set-up with to get started with the course in one place. That way, they
can’t get lost, which seemed to happen with the students this semester.
Especially about the contract, since several students didn’t know that
they had to do it, where it was, and someone also wrote everything in
the .md file and had to move it all over to the .rmd file. The current
lab will hopefully make the students a little more independent during
the onboarding, since there is only one place to go to and therefore a
lower chance of getting lost or confused.</li>
<li>Likewise, I have added a lot of scaffolding where the students are
guided through exactly what to do. This is to try to reduce their
cognitive load so that they can get used to the programs and going
through the motions first. Later in the course, there does not need to
be as much scaffolding.</li>
<li>I have tried to take out all unnecessary information or cool
features that they do not immediately need. This is again to reduce the
cognitive load so that they can focus on the main things now and then
deal with things like customizing the Rstudio themes later. I think that
will also make the students enjoy it more. I would therefore not take
out these facts and features, but move them to a later module.</li>
<li>I have based a lot of the concepts I elaborate on, such as file
types, on questions I got from other students or things I saw the other
students struggling with the course, as well as what I found challenging
and confusing myself. The lab does therefore hopefully elaborate on some
of the current main points of confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot of onboarding and introductions to do for this course,
so this lab ended up being divided into three sections. It is currently
written as a rough draft and they will need more editing before being
ready to be used. However, I think a little workshopping on the language
and adding in a little more air and numbered steps into the labs so that
they do not become as dense will go a long way. I hope these end up
becoming useful!</p>

<h1>Lab 0 - Getting Started and Setting up the Course</h1>
<p><br></p>
<div id="part-1---the-course-r-and-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 1 - The course, R, and Rstudio</h2>
<p>Hi, welcome to the first lab in your data science class! The
following lab will help you get an overview over the course, getting
started with R, and setting up the course. After doing this lab, you
should be ready to start fully engaging in the course and to code. There
are a lot of new concepts and programs when starting to code. However,
if you get past this first bit of the class, it will get more familiar
to you and it will get easier.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="course-overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<p>There are several components to the class. The biggest component is
the modules. Every week, you will work on a module. Each module has
videos, slides, and articles that will guide you through the material
covered in that module. Some modules have activities that you can work
on to learn the skills that are covered in the modules.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are two types of assignments in the class: labs
and portfolio projects. There is a lab after every module. So after
working through the module and learning about a topic, you can try it
out and show what you have learned in the lab. The portfolio projects
are done on the side and are a place where you can show what you have
learned in broader terms. Maybe you want to build on something you
learned from a module? Maybe you want to try out something you learned
from a module on your own data (like your thesis data)? Or maybe there
is something else you are curious about that you would like to learn
more about? All of these are great things to do for your portfolio
projects.</p>
<!--I didn't include any more information about grades and number of assignments, as I just want to introduce the overall structure of the class, especially since I will be referring to it later in the lab + they have all of that information available to them in the syllabus -->
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="syllabus" class="section level3">
<h3>Syllabus</h3>
<p>To get started with the class, you will want to know what is in the
syllabus. Therefore, if you haven’t already, read (or at least skim
over) the syllabus. You can find it <a
href="https://smasongarrison.github.io/syllabi/index.html">here</a>.
There is a general part to the syllabus, as well as a part specific for
this class. Read both the general and class-specific parts, that will
set you up for doing well in the course.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="downloading-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Downloading R</h3>
<p>After you have read the syllabus, you will have to download the
software that we will be using to program in this class. There are two
things you need to install. The first is R, which is the actual program
that runs your code and translate it into actions.</p>
<p>If you have a Windows computer, go to this <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">page</a> and
download R from the link saying “Download R for Windows”. There will be
a number in this title which is just the number of the current newest
version, so it doesn’t matter what the number is, as long as it says
Download R.</p>
<p>If you have a Mac, go to this <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">page</a> and download R
from the blue link to the left. It will say “R” with a number and some
other letters. That is the link you want to click on to download R.</p>
<p>If you have Linux, good for you! Go to this <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/">page</a> and click through
the relevant folders to get to the appropriate download file.</p>
<p>Click through the different prompts to successfully install R.</p>
<p>If you already have R installed on your computer from earlier,
reinstall R to get the most up-to-date version.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="testing-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Testing R</h3>
<p>Now, let’s make sure you successfully downloaded R on your
computer.</p>
<p>On Windows, click the Windows symbol in the bottom left corner of
your computer. Write “R” and see whether you can see an app called R
x.x.x where the x’s are some numbers indicating your version of R. If
you can’t see it, go to the Apps tab in the menu and you should find it
there.</p>
<p>On Mac, you can either click the Blue R icon with a grey circle
behind it or search for the R program by clicking Command and space, and
typing R. You will then see a program called R x.x.x where the x’s are
some numbers indicating your version of R.</p>
<p>You have now just opened R for the first time. To test it out, you
can type in a command which is traditionally the first thing code one
writes when learning programming. Type in “print(”Hello World!“)”
without the first and last quotation marks in the white box. You should
get an output stating “[1]”Hello World!““. You just ran your first code,
asking R to print the text Hello World!.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="downloading-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>Downloading RStudio</h3>
<p>As you might have noticed when writing this R code, is that the R
program has a very basic user interface (layout). The design is rather
old and there are not a lot of buttons and options. The R programming
language is in itself very well-done and advanced. However, it is made
for coding, not to have a cool layout and a lot of options outside the
code. People therefore generally use another program to provide a
graphic user interface (layout) that is easier to use and has more
options. One of the main ones, and the one we will use in this class, is
Rstudio.</p>
<p>You can download the Rstudio Desktop <a
href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">here</a>. The big blue
button to the right should have the right version for your computer.
However, you can also scroll further down on the page to see a list with
the download link for Windows, Mac, Linux, and so on.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="basics-of-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>Basics of Rstudio</h3>
<p>Now you can open Rstudio and start using it. You remember when you
tried writing your first code in R? You can now try to do the same in
Rstudio. Type in “print(”Hello World!“)” without the first and last
quotation marks in the little window at the bottom to the left, called
“Console”. That should produce the same output “[1]”Hello World!“” as
running this code in R itself, as all you did in the console was to run
the R code. However, as you might notice, there are several other
windows in Rstudio too. The bottom right window is where you can see all
the plots in your current project (which we will come back to soon). In
addition, there is also where you might see any plots you make, as well
as help pages for functions and libraries (more on that later). The top
right window is your environment. This shows everything you have saved
in your current R session. Since you have not saved anything yet, this
will be empty. However, later, when we do start to save variables, you
will see them listed in that window. Lastly, the top left window is
where you will likely write most of your code. It is where you create
documents with code that you can later save, similar to Word. Anything
you run in that window will be displayed in the Console window (bottom
left).</p>
<p>Now, lets try to actually do something in Rstudio. First, whenever
you work in Rstudio, you would likely want to create a project. A
project is like a Rstudio file that is saved in a folder on your
computer, that tells Rstudio where to look for relevant files.
Therefore, if you are doing anything that uses more than one file (which
is usually always), you want to create a project for it. This could for
example be if you have an R script(R code), as well as a data file that
you use with your R script. To create a project, click on “File” in the
top left corner and chose “New project”. Then chose “New directory”,
“New project”, and enter the name of the project, as well as chose where
to save your project by clicking “Browse” and saving your project in the
folder where you want it. You now have a new R project. You can see the
R project file in your “Files” window to the bottom right in Rstudio.
The file will be named NAME.Rproj, where NAME is the name you gave it,
and the “.Rproj” ending specified that the file type is an
R-project.</p>
<p>Next, you want to create a file with some R code in your project. The
most simple way to do this is to click on the button to the top left
that is a white box with a green circle with a white cross on it. Then,
chose “R script”. This will open a white page in the window to the top
left. You can write some R code in this window. For example, try typing
three things over three lines:</p>
<p>print(“Hello World!”) 3+5 min(3, 7, 12)</p>
<p>When you have the text in your document, highlight all three lines of
code and click on the button saying “Run” right above the window. When
you run the code, you can see that it pops up in the Console, the bottom
left window. You can also see that it runs each line separately and
gives you the output for each line. The blue text (with an arrow) is
your code, while the black text with a number before it is the output.
The first code printed the words “Hello World!”, the second code did 3 +
5, which is 8, and the third line of code found the minimum value of 3,
7, and 12, which is 3. The top left window therefore stores all your
code and when you run your code from this window, that sends the code to
the Console, where it runs the code and give you the output. You can
save your R script file by clicking the floppy disk (save) icon at the
top of the window to the top left.</p>
<p>Now, it is very useful to be able to easily save the code you run in
a document, like the Rscript you just created. However, it can get a bit
tedious to have all your code saved in the top left window and all of
the output in the bottom left window. In addition, you would maybe
sometimes want to add some text to the code and output, maybe to add an
interpretation of some output or an explanation of what the code is
doing. All of this is a lot easier in a file type called Rmarkdown,
which allows you to have code, output, and text in the same document.
The result is sort of like a report, where you see everything on the
same page.</p>
<p>Therefore, let us try to make an Rmarkdown file. You do this by
clicking on the button to the top left, the one that has a white box,
covered by a green circle, with a white cross in it. Chose “Rmarkdown”
and click “Ok” in the next box to open your Rmarkdown document. The
Rmarkdown document will already have some prefilled information. For
example, there is some text inside of three dashes (—). These dashes and
the information between the two lines of dashes is called the YAML
header. This is some general information about your document, such as
the title of it, the author, the date it was created, and the desired
output. You can easily change this information. For example, change the
title from “untitled” to “My first Rmarkdown document”. Next, change the
name that got added as default to how you want it written. Remember to
have your name and start and end it with a quotation sign (“).</p>
<p>Anything after the three dashes is the main text of your document.
There are two parts currently, the dark grey part is where your code
goes and anything white is normal text. The difference between the R
script you created earlier and the Rmarkdown document is that the R
script only had one type of input, the code. While the Rmarkdown
document has code, text, and as you will see later, output. Therefore,
the part that would normally be in an R script, is the same as is inside
of the grey boxes. The Rmarkdown document is therefore similar to the
Rscript, just that you can surround the code (grey boxes) with normal
text and output. Let us try this. Instead of having the three lines you
had in your R script all together, try adding each line to each of the
three grey boxes you currently have in your Rmarkdown document. To do
this, leave the first and last line of the grey box (contains ’’’) as it
is, but switch out the middle line with one of the lines of code from
your R script. Then, add a sentence or two above each plot that explains
what the code does. When adding normal text, make sure you do so on the
white background and not inside of the code chunks (which are grey).
Then, you can delete the other text on the white background that was
there from when you created the Rmarkdown document. That means anything
that is not in the grey boxes, nor in the YAML header.</p>
<p>Now, you can run the code you added. There are two ways in which to
do this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You can run each code individually in the document. You do this by
clicking on the green arrow to the top right on the code chunk (grey
box) you want to run. Do this for all three code chunks. You can see
that the output of the code chunk pops up below the code chunk as the
code is ran.</li>
<li>You can “knit” the report, which means that you run all of the code
at once, and that Rstudio produces a report that contains your code,
output, and text. Try doing this by hitting the blue yarn ball symbol
that says “Knit” at the top of the top left window. You can see your
report pop up when it is done in the right bottom window where you can
read it over.</li>
</ol>
<p>Running individual code chunk can be helpful when you are writing
code or just want to see one part of the code. However, knitting the
document gives you an overview of all of the code and output. Knitting
the document also runs all the code over again, so if you were to make a
change in a code chunk above the one you are currently working on, this
could create problems if you do not update the code in-between before
running some later code. This potential problem is not a concern when
knitting a document, since all the code gets re-run anyway. You start
with a clean slate.</p>
<p>If you look back at your files in the bottom right window (you might
have to click the “Files” tab to see the files and not your knitted
Rmarkdown report), you can see that there are two new files there. One
is the Rmarkdown file you created with the code and text. The file has
the ending “.Rmd” in its file name. When you knit this file, it will
automatically save all changes to the .Rmd file and produce a new file
with your report. Your Rmarkdown document it set to output html code by
default (you can see that the output it specified to html in the YAML
header). However, you might also in some instances see that it produces
an .md file, which is often used for Github. The .html and .md files
look very similar, they are just optimized for being displayed with
different programs. If you want to sometime just look at your report,
you can click on the .html or .md file in the “Files” window to the
bottom right and chose either “Open in editor” which shows it in the
same window, or “View in Web Browser” which opens it in full view in
your web browser instead.</p>
<p>Be aware, that any time you rerun your .Rmd file, you update the .md
or .html file. Therefore, you never want to make changes directly to the
.md or .html files. If you want to change your report, you would instead
change it in the .Rmd file and re-knit the file to update your
report.</p>

<h2>Part 2 - Github</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to use Rstudio and do some basics line of code
with R, we will move on to how we will save our work in this class and
setting up the components of the class, such as the grading contract,
your portfolio, and your labs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="github" class="section level3">
<h3>Github</h3>
<p>We looked at R and Rstudio in part 1 of this lab and learned how to
write some basic lines of code and how to use Rmarkdown documents to
produce reports with code, output, and text. Now, we will look at how we
can save our work so that it is accessible for others and so that we
always have a backup if we were to lose the files on our own computer.
We are going to do this through a program called Github.</p>
<p>So, what is Github? Github is a cloud-based system, just like Google
Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud. What they all have in common, is that you
save your work somewhere else than on your computer. That way, if
something were to happen with your computer, you could still access your
files. The fact that the files are stored in a cloud simply means that
they are stored somewhere on the internet, so that you can access them
through an account, regardless of which computer or device you are
using. There is a cloud system that is very commonly used among
programmers and software developers, and that is Github. It is therefore
useful to know how to navigate Github, so that you can participate in
world as a true programmer.</p>
<p>The first step you have to take is to create a <a
href="https://github.com/">Github account</a>. I strongly suggest that
you use your Wake Forest email to create this account, as that will
automatically give you student access, which offers pro benefits for
free.</p>
<details>
<summary>
What if I already have a GitHub account that is not affiliated with my
school email?
</summary>
<p>If you already have a GitHub account that is not affiliated with your
school account, you can manually apply for student access. You can do
this by clicking on the “Join GitHub Education” on <a
href="https://github.com/education">this page</a>. It will require you
to submit an enrollment verification, which you can get in a few days by
applying for it on Workday. Be aware that someone at GitHub will then
look at your account to see whether it seems plausible that your account
and the enrollment letter belongs to the same person. It is therefore
advisable to include as much information on your GitHub profile as you
can to identify you. You can for example add a picture of yourself, a
description of being a Wake Forest student, add your full name, and a
billing address. If you do not add any of this information, your
application will likely be denied, so make sure you do this too.</p>
</details>
<p><br> Be aware when making your GitHub account that this account is
widely used in the programming world as a protfolio or CV or one’s
programming skills and that the accounts therefore often tends to be
somewhat formal. You can use an user name such as “funnypunny”, but if
you create some good public projects and contribute to others projects
with that account, would you want to add that username on your CV?
Instead, make sure you add an user name you would be ok making public to
a company or at your workplace later. It doesn’t have to include your
own name, but this could be beneficial if you want people to find you
easier.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Further tips about chosing a GitHub username
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re
dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or
remember.</li>
<li>Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be
squatting on that.</li>
<li>Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future
boss.</li>
<li>Shorter is better than longer.</li>
<li>Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some
settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.</li>
<li>Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer,
or place of residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.</li>
<li>Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming. In Jenny’s
first inept efforts to script around the GitHub API, she assigned lots
of issues to the guy with username NA because my vector of GitHub
usernames contained missing values. A variant of Little Bobby
Tables.</li>
<li>Avoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly
recommend all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive
way, but using all lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream
regular expression work with usernames, in various languages. A better
strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen - or underscore _.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p><br> After making your account, you will also want to download GitHub
desktop. You can download it at <a
href="https://desktop.github.com/download/">this link</a>. when it is
downloaded, log in with the same account that you just made for the
online version of GitHub.</p>
<p>After you have successfully downloaded GitHub desktop, go back to
Github in your browser and create your first repository. You can do this
by clicking on the plus icon to the top right of the main page and
choose “New Repository”. You have to create a name for your repository,
call it lab_0 or something similar. Then you can choose whether the
repository is public or private. It is also good practice to add a
README file, which you can do by checking the box for adding a README
file. Click Create to create the repository. Now, you have an account on
Github and your first repository, which is like a project. It is like a
folder where you can save all of the work and files associated with a
project. The repository is now associated with your account, so that you
can log onto Github anywhere and find it.</p>
<p>However, running long and complicated code on your computer from the
cloud can be slow and you might also sometimes want to work on your code
even when you don’t have access to internet. Therefore, we want to make
a local copy of the repository on your computer, so that you can have
the files associated with the project on your own computer locally too,
and not just in the cloud. To do this, click on the green “&lt;&gt;
Code” button in your repository and choose “Open with GitHub Desktop”.
GitHub Desktop should launch automatically and you will get a menu that
says “Clone a repository”. Cloning a repository means to make a copy of
it. In this case, you are making a local copy (stored on your computer)
of your remote repository (stored in the cloud by GitHub). The URL of
your repository should be filled out automatically and the box for the
local path is where on your computer you want to save the repository.
You can chose a folder on your computer where you have some of your
other materials for this class or somewhere else you want it. Be sure
that you can find back to it again later though.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="using-github" class="section level3">
<h3>Using GitHub</h3>
<p>Now that you have made a repository and cloned it, let us try to see
whether you can get the two repositories (same project) talk to each
other. In Rstudio, click on the “File” button in the top left corner and
create a new project. You can name it whatever you want and the rest of
the information is not that important. The important part is that you
save it inside of the folder that is your local repository. That means,
inside the folder you created when cloning your repository in GitHub.
Now that you have initiated an Rproject, open a new Rmarkdown file
(click on the white box with a green circle with a white cross in the
top left corner and chose “R markdown”), and save it the same folder
with the repository (this should be folder you are currently working
in). It does not matter what you name the file and you do not have to
edit any of the text, just leave it as it is. You do however want to
knit it, so click on the button with the blue ball of yarn that says
“Knit” above your window with text from your Rmarkdown file. Wait until
you see the output document pop up.</p>
<p>If you now go to GitHub desktop, you can see that the file name for
your Rmarkdown file will be in the left window in GitHub Desktop. Make
sure that the check box before that file is checked. The fact that the
file shows up, means that there are changes to that file in your local
repository (on your computer) that doesn’t exist on the remote
repository (in the cloud). When you check the box for the file, you are
saying that you want to update that file in the remote repository. Then,
before we actually send the changes to the remote repository (which is
called “Push), we have to give this update a name. Write in a short name
in the summary section that is informative, so that if you look back at
the message, you will know what you changed. In this example, it could
for example be”Added a test Rmarkdown file”. When you have your summary,
you can push the blue button at the bottom of the page called “Commit to
main”. This action creates an update that is ready to send somewhere.
Then, click on the “push” button at the top of the page to actually
“send” the updates to your remote repository. Now, you can go into your
repository on the online version of GitHub and see that your file has
been added there. It is also possible to make changes the opposite way,
by getting changes from your remote repository to your local repository.
This is done through a “pull” (instead of push), but we will not be
requiring doing that for this class.</p>

<div id="part-3---setting-up-the-course" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 3 - Setting up the Course</h2>
<p>Now that you have learned about R, Rstudio, and using GitHub, you can
get started on the course work. However, it might be helpful to set up
some of the the assignments and requirements for the class. In this
section, we will work on setting up the course by prepping three
things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contract</li>
<li>Setting up your portfolio</li>
<li>Seeing how you hand in labs</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<div id="the-contract" class="section level3">
<h3>The contract</h3>
<p>The class is set up to be flexible and as a part of that, you have to
fill out a grade contract where you set up which grade you are trying to
get and a time line of when do to the projects and assignments required
to get that grade. You can read more about this contract grading in the
syllabus <a
href="https://smasongarrison.github.io/syllabi/data-science.html#grading-policy-3">here</a>.
There is a template contract that you can use to make your contract, so
the first thing we need to do to make this contract is to get that
template from GitHub and make our own repository for it.</p>
<p>Go the the following <a
href="https://github.com/DataScience4Psych/template_contract">webpage to
find the contract template</a>. This is one of the benefits of using
GitHub, as one can share a repository with files that others can use,
such as this contract template. To use the template, you want to click
on the green button at the top right that says “Use this template” and
choose “Create a new repository”. Then you make the repository like
usual. You can choose whether you want to make this repository public or
private. If you make it public, anyone who looks at your profile or has
a link can see it. If you make it private, you have to add Mason as a
collaborator on your repository for her to be able to see it. It is
therefore probably easier to make it public, but if you would want to
make it private, there are ways in which you can do that too. After you
have made a remote repository (in the cloud), you want to clone the
repository to your computer (= creating a local repository), so that you
can work on the contract on your own computer. To open the local
repository on your computer, open Rstudio, choose “File” in the upper
left corner, and click on “Open Project…”. Find the file ending on
“Rproj.” in your repository and open that project. This works since the
contract template that was made for you included several files,
including an R project.</p>
<p>Now, you want to start filling in the contract. You can see that the
repository has a .Rmd and .md file. Remember that you edit files that
end with .Rmd and when you knit these files, those updates will show up
in your .md or .html report. So, open the file ending with .Rmd and
follow the instructions to fill out the contract. When you are done,
knit the contract, stage the edits, make a commit message, and push your
changes to your remote repository. Then go onto Github to make sure that
your changes are visible in your remote repository.</p>
<p>Now, it is time to hand in your contract. To do this, you need to
find the repository that is for handing in your contract for your
semester. This is typically called year_contract, where year is the
current year. You can find it by searching for contract in the
repositories at the Data Science for Psychologists GitHub <a
href="https://github.com/DataScience4Psych?q=contract&amp;type=all&amp;language=&amp;sort=">course
page</a>. Click on the repository and then the “Issues” tab at the top
of the page. Then click the green “New issue” button to create a
submission for your contract. You add a title, which should contain your
name and for the main text, you want to link to your repository,
preferably both the .rmd file and the .md file. That way, it is easy to
look at the output you have created, as well as the code behind it. To
link to your repository, add a square bracket “[”, write the text you
have to be displayed, for example ”Contract .rmd file”, then a closing
square bracket ”]”, then an opening parenthesis “(”, the url or link to
your file in GitHub online, and a closing parenthesis “)”. Do this for
both of your files. If you are unsure of the link to your files, you can
find them by going into your contract repository, clicking on the file
you want the link for and copying the link to that page. If you have any
comments or questions, you can also add those to your issue/submission.
When you are done, you can click the green “Create” button at the bottom
right to submit the issue. Make sure everything looks good and
double-check the links to make sure they lead the reader to the right
place. This is how you will submit all assignments for the course.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you just completed your first assignment!</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="the-portfolio" class="section level3">
<h3>The portfolio</h3>
<p>Now, you have to set up your portfolio. This is where you will have
all the projects you are making for the course. You want to create a
repository, based on the provided template, for your portfolio. You can
find the template <a
href="https://github.com/DataScience4Psych/template_portfolio">here</a>.
Clone the repository like we did earlier for the contract, by clicking
the green “Use this template” button and creating a new repository. This
creates a remote repository (in the cloud). Then you also want to make a
local repository by linking your computer to the remote repository you
just created. You do this by going to your repository on GitHub,
clicking the green “Code” button and clicking “Open with GitHub
Desktop”. Make sure to save the local repository somewhere you can find
it later.</p>
<p>The template you just cloned (copied) allows you to host a webpage on
GitHub’s page with your portfolio pieces. There are a few more settings
to follow to publish your webpage so that you can find it with an URL.
To do this, follow the instructions in the ReadMe in your portfolio
repository. The Readme file is always displayed at the bottom of the
repository, so you can scroll past all your files to see it. You should
always look at the Readme file when looking at someones repository as it
contains important information you need to engage with the repository.
Readme files are very common, but not mandatory, so you might
occasionally find repositories without them. You have already started on
some of the steps in the Readme, so you can jump directly to step 7 to
get your webpage published.</p>
<p>When you get your URL, click on it to see your webpage. This is here
everything you do for your projects will be displayed. Save the link
somewhere, as you will need it in the next step.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="handing-in-the-lab" class="section level3">
<h3>Handing in the lab</h3>
<p>You have made it all the way to the end! Well done! This is probable
one of the hardest and most overwhelming parts of the course. However,
these pages will always be here for reference if you need to come back
to see how you hand in anything or where your components are.</p>
<p>The last thing to do before you are done, is to hand in your lab.
First you want to go to the <a
href="https://github.com/DataScience4Psych?q=portfol&amp;type=all&amp;language=&amp;sort=">course
page</a> on GitHub and find the relevant lab submission repository. You
can search for lab_0 and see whether you can find the repository for
your course, meaning it has a year in front of it. Click on that
repository and create an issue in it by clicking on the “Issues” tab at
the top of the page. Then click on the green “New issue” button to the
right on the page and fill in a title that has your name on it. For the
text in the issue, you want to add the URL to your portfolio webpage
which you saved earlier. Then if you have any comments or questions you
can add them underneath. Then you can click on the green “Create” button
to submit your issue (submission). That was it for this lab. Remember
for future labs that when you start a lab, you want to clone the
template repository (like we did for the contract and portfolio) and
then when you submit your lab you want to find the repository that is
specific for your year and create an issue (submission) with a link to
your repository with that lab in it.</p>
