<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Making a lab 0</h1>

</div>


<p>I made this lab instead of doing one myself. I remember the beginning
of the class being overwhelming and confusing for some people, so I will
make a lab that goes over how to get started and set up the class. This
will be especially helpful for when the class is adapted for
undergrads.</p>
<p>One of the main changes that would make the beginning of the class
easier is: Change up module 0 and 1 and lab 1. Make the things they are
doing clearer and not have unecessary information this early on.</p>
<p>Strip out all of the customization and cool stuff from the first one
or two modules. It is fine later on, but to beging with everything is
new and overwhelming. I think you would be better off giving students
just the bare minimum and keep all customizations and cool things as
either ODD or as cool facts later.</p>
<p>The thought is that lab 0 can be included in module 0. However,
module 0 and 1 should probably be edited a little for this lab to fit
in. I think that will overall make the ease into the class easier. I am
basing this on my experinece (as I didn’t know Git before starting), as
well as all of the students I was helping during the first few weeks of
the class. Some problems kept coming up and I have tried to make this
lab so that those confusions won’t occur as much.</p>
<p>Some other general notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The language is too technical in the beginning, it is probably
intimidating for people that are already overwhelmed by all the new
stuff. For example, “Install R, a free software environment for
statistical computing and graphics from CRAN, the Comprehensive R
Archive Network. I highly recommend you install a precompiled binary
distribution for your operating system – use the links up at the top of
the CRAN page linked above!” Dumb it down to the bare necessities,
students don’t need to know all of this. It is like the scaffolding with
the labs, you start with a lot of scaffolding (and dumbing down) and
then you can add more advanced stuff (and language) later.</li>

class="section level1">
<h1>Lab 0 - Getting Started and Setting up the Course</h1>
<p>Hi, welcome to the first lab in your data science class! The
following lab will help you get an overview over the course, getting
started with R, and setting up the course. After doing this lab, you
should be ready to start fully engaging in the course and to code. There
are a lot of new concepts and programs when starting to code. However,
if you get past this first bit of the class, it will get more familiar
to you and it will get easier.</p>
<div id="course-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>There are several components to the class. The biggest component is
the modules. Every week, you will work on a module. Each module has
videos, slides, and articles that will guide you through the material
covered in that module. Some modules have activities that you can work
on to learn the skills that are covered in the modules.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are two types of assignments in the class: labs
and portfolio projects. There is a lab after every module. So after
working through the module and learning about a topic, you can try it
out and show what you have learned in the lab. The portfolio projects
are done on the side and are a place where you can show what you have
learned in broader terms. Maybe you want to build on something you
learned from a module? Maybe you want to try out something you learned
from a module on your own data (like your thesis data)? Or maybe there
is something else you are curious about that you would like to learn
more about? All of these are great things to do for your portfolio
projects.</p>
<!--I didn't include any more information about grades and number of assignments, as I just want to introduce the overall structure of the class, especially since I will be referring to it later in the lab + they have all of that information available to them in the syllabus -->
</div>
<div id="syllabus" class="section level2">
<h2>Syllabus</h2>
<p>To get started with the class, you will want to know what is in the
syllabus. Therefore, if you haven’t already, read (or at least skim
over) the syllabus. You can find it <a
href="https://smasongarrison.github.io/syllabi/index.html">here</a>.
There is a general part to the syllabus, as well as a part specific for
this class. Read both the general and class-specific parts, that will
set you up for doing well in the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="downloading-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Downloading R</h2>
<p>After you have read the syllabus, you will have to download the
software that we will be using to program in this class. There are two
things you need to install. The first is R, which is the actual program
that runs your code and translate it into actions.</p>
<p>If you have a Windows computer, go to this <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">page</a> and
download R from the link saying “Download R for Windows”. There will be
a number in this title which is just the number of the current newest
version, so it doesn’t matter what the number is, as long as it says
Download R.</p>
<p>If you have a Mac, go to this <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">page</a> and download R
from the blue link to the left. It will say “R” with a number and some
other letters. That is the link you want to click on to download R.</p>
<p>If you have Linux, good for you! Go to this <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/">page</a> and click through
the relevant folders to get to the appropriate download file.</p>
<p>Click through the different prompts to successfully install R.</p>
<p>If you already have R installed on your computer from earlier,
reinstall R to get the most up-to-date version.</p>
</div>
<div id="testing-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Testing R</h2>
<p>Now, let’s make sure you successfully downloaded R on your
computer.</p>
<p>On Windows, click the Windows symbol in the bottom left corner of
your computer. Write “R” and see whether you can see an app called R
x.x.x where the x’s are some numbers indicating your version of R. If
you can’t see it, go to the Apps tab in the menu and you should find it
there.</p>
<p>On Mac, you can either click the Blue R icon with a grey circle
behind it or search for the R program by clicking Command and space, and
typing R. You will then see a program called R x.x.x where the x’s are
some numbers indicating your version of R.</p>
<p>You have now just opened R for the first time. To test it out, you
can type in a command which is traditionally the first thing code one
writes when learning programming. Type in “print(”Hello World!“)”
without the first and last quotation marks in the white box. You should
get an output stating “[1]”Hello World!““. You just ran your first code,
asking R to print the text Hello World!.</p>
</div>
<div id="downloading-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Downloading RStudio</h2>
<p>As you might have noticed when writing this R code, is that the R
program has a very basic user interface (layout). The design is rather
old and there are not a lot of buttons and options. The R programming
language is in itself very well-done and advanced. However, it is made
for coding, not to have a cool layout and a lot of options outside the
code. People therefore generally</p>
<p>Have them open R and test it out. Explain what it is, then introduce
R studio</p>
