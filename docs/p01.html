<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Improving the Code for the Grading
Contract</h1>

</div>


<p>I found a few areas of improvement in the code for the grading
contract. After testing out a few things, it looks like the original
code is ok, but could be scaled up to add in some additional useful
features. The following project will try to do this.</p>
<p>Goals for the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get familiar with some of the functionalities I don’t know as well
with Rmarkdown, such as place holders</li>
<li>Get practice reading and understandig others’ code and editing
it</li>
<li>Practice designing/updating code to solve a problem identified in
the code, in other words, translating an idea to code.</li>
<li>Working with dates in R (tidyverse)</li>
<li>Add some features that I would like for the contract to have and
therefore have it bug me less</li>
</ul>
<div id="rmarkdown-basics" class="section level2">
<h2>Rmarkdown Basics</h2>
<p>The following are some notes from things I have learned or wanted to
remember while working on this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make a new paragraph, make two new lines, not just one</li>
<li>When making bullet point lists, you can use “*” or “-”, but there
has to be a new line before the start of the first bullet point for the
formatting to work correctly</li>
<li>To embed a link with text, write the text you want displayed in
brackets and right after put the link in parenthesis</li>
<li>You can also make a new paragraph by ending the last line of a
paragraph with two spaces. Or add a backslash at the end of the
line.</li>
<li>“&gt;” before some text leads to a block quote</li>
<li>“[ ]” creates an unchecked box, while [x] creates a checked box. In
html, the formatting gets weird with checked boxes. It turns bold
automatically and adds extra space for the next line. However, if making
it a Github document, it shows up with the expected formatting</li>
<li>Write &lt; ! - - - text - - &gt; (with no spaces between the
characters) to write a comment in the Rmarkdown document that does not
show up on the rendered output.
<ul>
<li>Note that if you write the code for in-text r code (tick mark, r,
code, and tick mark) in this type of comment, it will actually run that
code</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You get <strong>bold</strong> text from adding “**” before and after
the text you want in bold</li>
</ul>
<p>Useful links:</p>

<div id="the-current-contract-code" class="section level2">
<h2>The Current Contract Code</h2>
<p>The following is the content of the current Rmarkdown document for
the contract. It is pasted here for reference so that one can see what
the original contract looked liked. In addition, this copy will be used
to take notes while going over it to understand and document how the
original code works. There will therefore be many comments added
throughout this code to explain what the current code is doing. This
will help me better understand what to change and how. Throughout
working with the original document, I have tinkered with it to figure
out what the different parts of the code do. That process is not
documented here, as that would be too time consuming. So, here is the
original contract with my comments added as block quotes. All of the
formatting that makes code runnable has been removed so that we will see
the code and not the output of it, as well as so that it doesn’t take up
additional time executing the code when knitting the document.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following is the YAML header.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It states the title of the document, the date, which is today’s date
retrieved from the computer/system running the document.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>title: Grading Contract<br />
date: “format(Sys.time(), ‘%B %d %Y’)”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The output is currently set to html, even though the original was a
github document (.md), as it is quicker to visualize html documents when
working with Rmarkdown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>output: html_document</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then we have the parameters that will be used during the rest of the
contract. This is what makes the document dynamic. The information
required is the first date for the class (weekonemonday), the thesis
deadline, and the date for spring break. Then it asks for the name of
the person writing the contract, how many labs and projects they are
doing, the grade they want, and the day of the week they want the due
dates to be on. The grade and due date day has explicit options that the
user can chose between several grades and several days, from what is
included under “choices”. Then whatever the individual wants is what is
put under “value”.</p>

<p>Here we define a function that is giving formatted output with the
right values (e.g. dates) based on the parameters we have given in the
YAML header. This function will be used to fill in most of the place
holders in the contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>advdate &lt;- function(weekonemonday, week, topic = NULL, assignment
= NULL, unit = “Module”) {</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The function takes 5 parameters. One is what we defined as the date
for the first Monday of classes. The second one is which week we are in,
indexed by an integer. Then what topic we are on (which is indexed from
a list we will define later, called topic). The next one is the
assignment, which seems to be the same as the due date day, for example
Monday. If this is null, it gives you a string with the module number,
start and end date of the week, and the topic for that module. However,
if it is set to be a day (not null), it will instead give a simplified
string with just the date of the day that the deadline is on that week.
Lastly, unit seems to just store the string “module” that is pasted into
the strings. These last three parameteres have default values, so they
are optional.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The below code takes what week we are in and calculates the date for
each weekday, starting from when the first day of class is. The date
variable weekonemondy is converted to a date object later in the code
(but before the function is called) and stored in the variable dayone.
If not, the code wouldn’t run due to trying to run operations that
require an object to be date when it isn’t. To illustrate the output of
this code, tmon for week 1 could be “01/13”.</p>

formatting of a string with information about the module number, start

<p>The first condition is if there is no topic or assignment (which is
set to NULL by default). This will therefore mostly occur if there are
no more topics to go over. It will produce something like “Module 01,
01/13 - 01/17”. We don’t seem to use this in the code, it is probably
just there to catch a situation in which there are fewer modules than
weeks in the semester.</p>

<p>If assignment (the day of the week assignments are due on) is still
empty, but there is a topic, you get formatting similar to “01/17”.
Paste0 is used to paste the results together. However, I don’t think you
need paste0() here when there is only one variable. You also probably
don’t need to catch all varioations of the spelling of the weekdays, as
the options of how to write it that work with the code, are in the
choices for that parameter in the YAML header.</p>

<h3>Further guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>According to reasons discussed and agreed upon in advance with the
professor, there are some situations which might require some of these
deadlines to be moved. If this is the case, I will reach out to the
professor and agree on another deadline. The number of assignments that
have to be completed satisfactory will not change.</li>
<li>If the professor has any concerns about the assignments and whether
they reach the standards of being completed “satisfactory”, the
professor will communicate these concerns with me and, if deemed
appropriate, offer an opportunity to correct them.</li>
<li>I pertain the right to, at any time, switch out any of the modules
and labs with another module or lab in the course or change the order of
them from what is currently specified in the contract. This will not
affect the number of labs or modules that are to be completed according
to the contract. Any such changes will be noted in this contract for
reference, but will not require notifying the professor.</li>
<li>Any other part of this contract can be changed before the final
grade is set if agreed upon by both myself and the professor.</li>
</ul>

<div id="goals-for-the-new-contract" class="section level1">
<h1>Goals For the New Contract</h1>
<p>Things to improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is generally poorly commented and some of it is not ordered
chronologically considering the order in which humans tend to read code.
mild spaghetti code (no offense). So, the new code will have much more
extensive coding and will try to put things in the order it is read in
by humans, to make the readability better.</li>
<li>The variable names could sometimes be more enlightening, so these
will be updated</li>
<li>There are some parts of the function that are never used. This can
be deleted and potentially dealt with as error checking instead, if
needed. There are also some additional fail-safe’s, like allowing for
“Monday”, “monday”, “Mon”, and “m”, which doesn’t seem necessary as the
YAML header specifically states the available options to put in. If
anyone puts in a shorthand that doesn’t work with the code, they should
be able to figure that out based on the options provided in the YAML
header.</li>
<li>The current code will only allow for the insertion of spring break
if you add it as a topic. However, that will shift all the module
numbers so that they do not align with the topic. This will be changed,
so that they module number is correct for each topic.</li>
<li>You can currently not have the weekly deadlines be on Sundays, which
is a typical day to have deadlines on. I’ll add the opportunity for the
deadlines to be on Saturday and Sunday.</li>
<li>It can be hard to understand the logic of the document, especially
if one is not familiar with Rmarkdown yet. This is likely the case for
several students, so I’ll also write and include instructions on how to
navigate the document and what it does throughout the contract.</li>
<li>Now, one has to look to the syllabus to see how many labs and
portfolio projects to finish given the desired grade. I will put this in
automatically based on the grade they add that they want to contract for
in their YAML header, so that the student don’t need to provide it
themselves.</li>

<h1>The Improved Contract</h1>
<p>This is a copy of the improved contract, attached for reference.
There might be minor variations between this version and the final
version attached (“p01_contract.Rmd”)in the ds_portfolio repository.
However, The code should be more or less the same between the two
versions.</p>
<p>Comments in the code have been changed out with block quotes, as the
hash tag symbol would have been rendered as a header if not inside a
code block. However, the comments that are here in the block quotes are
the same as are in the improved template. In addition, there are
comments that are only visible in the Rmarkdown document, but not in the
knitted output (github file). These comments are to guide the students
through how to use the contract. I will denote those here as “comment:”,

<p>Cooment: How to use this Rmarkdown document The text above this
comment is the YAML header. Change the variables under “params” into
what is relevant for you and your situation. In cases where there are
choices, you have to choose one of those choices. Make sure you spell
your parameter the same was as one of the choices and also to have the
same capital or small letters.</p>
<p>The parameters that you have specified in the YAML header will be
used in the rest of the code to change out place holders
(variables/unknows).</p>
<p>The gray boxes are r code. Since there is a “include = FALSE” command
in the header of each code block, the code itself will run and used to
produce the rest of the document. However, the code itself will not show
up in your output when you knit the document.</p>
<p>The first code chunk sets the number of labs and portfolio projects
you need, based on what grade you are writing the contract for. You
should double check that this number is the same as what is currently
stated in the syllabus as being the requirement for that grade. The
second code chunk defines some variables we need and the list with the
topics for the modules. Double-check that all the modules that are
currently available are in that list. If not, you should update the list
to reflect the modules that are currently available in the course. The
third code chunk defines a function that takes in some parameters
(information you provide when using the function) and turns that into a
string (text) that we use in the contract to fill out information, for
example with the relevant module names and dates. –&gt;</p>

<p>Comment: The next part here is the text that will actually be
displayed in your output of the document. The #, ##, or ### before text
indicates that this is a header. The number of “#”’s correspond to the
level of the heading. So, a “#” Heading will be in a bigger font than a
“##” Header.</p>
<p>The text that consists of “tick”r text”tick” (I can’t actually write
it with the ticks here, as that would have been interpreted by r as code
to run and I would have gotten an error) is in-line r code. It will run
the r code and the output will be pasted there in the text when you knit
the document.</p>
<p>In addition, any call to params$[input parameter here] calls the
parameter you inputted in the YAML header. So, for example, if you put
in A as a grade, the string below will produce a text stating “Terms to
Get a Grade of”A”“.</p>
<p>The r codes with the parameters should paste the value or text that
you need. If it seems off, double-check that you put in the right
parameter (e.g. that you didn’t misspell anything).</p>
<p>There is also some code that calls a function called string_details.
This is the function we defined (made) earlier to make the strings
(text) we need. The parameters (values) we provide when calling (using)
the function determines the text that we get from it.</p>
<p>Now, to move on, read over the text for the contract and change or
add anything you want to change. –&gt;</p>

<li>According to reasons discussed and agreed upon in advance with the

to the contract. It could however move a deadline for a lab to the
appropriate deadline considering the module the lab belongs to. For
example, if deciding to switch out lab 11 with lab 12, then lab 12 will
be due the week I work on module 12, not module 11. Any such changes to
modules or labs will be noted in this contract for reference, but will
not require notifying the professor otherwise.</li>
<li>Any other part of this contract can be changed before the final

<p>Comment: Now, I suggest that you knit the document. You can do this
by pushing the “Knit” button with a blue yarn ball above this screen in
Rmarkdown. To see the changes, push it to Github and look at the file
there (it should have the .md file extension). If you feel more
advanced, you can also change the output type to a html document in the
YAML header and you will get the output in Rmarkdown itself. However,
note that this will mess up some of the formatting, so I suggest to only
do this temporarily while messing with the document and then switching
back to the Github document type.</p>
<p>When looking at your knitted document, you will now see the standard
schedule based on the dates and information you put in as parameters in
the YAML header. There are a few things I suggest you look over and
change as it fits you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are currently more modules than there are weeks in the
semester. That means that you can’t get through all the modules. If you
want, you can switch out any of the modules in the contract with another
module. The module is determined based on the number inputted as the
third parameter in the string_details function. For example, in the
following code “string_details(monday_week_one, 11, 12, modules_list)”,
the module number would be 12. If you are wondering what module module
12 is, you can go to the code block that defines (creates) the list
“module_list” and count. Module 12 would be the topic that corresponds
to the 12th topic in that list.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, there are also more labs that what is required to
get an “A”. You can therefore also change which labs you are doing. This
is just written in the standard text (not code) in the contract, so to
do that, simple remove the line with the lab you don’t want and add it
somewhere else, changing out the lab number. For example, if you do not
want to do lab 10, delete the line stating “- [ ] Finish Lab 10 by r
deadline_day: r string_details(monday_week_one, 11,
deadline_day=deadline_day)” and add this, switching out the lab number
with another lab you want to do (and any other parameteres that need to
be adjusted) under the relevant week/module in the text.</p></li>
<li><p>You can move around when the labs and any of the other things
that have to be done are due. You can do this simply by copy pasting the
text and code associated with it and move it around. For example, if you
know that you have a busy week around week 11 of the semester, you might
want to move the deadline for portfolio project 5 to another week, for
example week 12. One example could for example be to look at when the
the thesis is due and maybe move deadlines away from that week.</p></li>
<li><p>Look over when spring break is and move any assignments to other
weeks (unless you want deadlines during spring break)</p></li>
<li><p>As you finish assignments or modules, you can mark them with a
check. The “[ ]” indicates an empty check box, while “[x]” indicates a
checked box. In the end, your document should have all the empty check
boxes (“[ ]”) filled in (“[x]”)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you are done with the edits to the contract, you can knit it
again, push it to Github, and look over it to see that everything looks
good. It you are satisfied with how it looks, you can hand it in.
