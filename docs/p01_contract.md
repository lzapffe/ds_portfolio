# Contract Grades – “A” Contract

I, Linn Zapffe, agree to :

1)  Earn “Satisfactory” on 11 self-paced lab assignments on the schedule
    specified below. Getting a grade of “Satisfactory” requires that:

- I have attempted all steps of the assignment. If unable to complete
  steps due to unresolved questions, I have asked questions in Github
  FAQs or during the help sessions, or I have Googled the issue and
  shown effort to resolve questions;
  - I have checked that files, repos, or projects appear on my Github
    account and are accessible;
  - I feel like I have spent an adequate amount of time and energy on
    assignments;

2)  Produce at least 10 “Satisfactory” portfolio pieces on the schedule
    specified below. Getting a grade of “Satisfactory” requires that:
    - I have designed a portfolio project that I think challenges my
      understanding of programming, explores a modules_list I want to
      know more about, or targets something I feel like I need more
      practice with;
    - I have checked that files, repos, or projects appear on my Github
      account and are accessible;

## Further guidelines

- According to reasons discussed and agreed upon in advance with the
  professor, there are some situations which might require some of these
  deadlines to be moved. If this is the case, I will reach out to the
  professor and agree on another deadline. The number of assignments
  that have to be completed satisfactory will not change.
- If the professor has any concerns about the assignments and whether
  they reach the standards of being completed “satisfactory”, the
  professor will communicate these concerns with me and offer an
  opportunity to correct them.
- I pertain the right to switch or switch out any of the modules that do
  not contain a lab with another module in the course. This can be done
  in advance or while working on a module.
- Any part of this contract can be changed before the final grade is set
  if agreed upon by both myself and the professor.

Change out any labs too (there are 13)
