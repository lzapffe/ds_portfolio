<h1 class="title toc-ignore">GitKraken and Advanced Workflows</h1>

</div>


<p>This project will look into GitKraken and more advanced workflows
with Git/GitKraken. First, it will involve switching from using GitHub
to GitKraken. Then, it will involve learning about more advanced
workflows that might not be 100% necessary for projects that I am
working on currently for this class, but which could involve a lot of
fail-safes for when I potentially work with more advanced and
comprehensive projects. It is better to learn how to do this now than
later, when I really need it. Therefore, this project will have the
following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>To set up GitKraken successfully</li>
<li>Learn basic usage of GitKraken, such as pulling, pushing, and
connecting to local repositories</li>
<li>Learn about more advanced workflows with Git, such as using forks,
merges, and branches</li>
<li>To become comfortable using GitKraken and more advanced
workflows</li>
<li>The final goal of this project will be to create a pull request from
a forked version of this class to update the contract template that was
made in project 1, as well as change some other minor problems, such as
broken or out-of-date links in the course</li>
</ul>

<h1>GitKraken</h1>
<div id="setting-up-gitkraken" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting up GitKraken</h2>
<p>Got GitKraken downloaded and signed in. It is now also linked to
Github (by following the prompting in the GitKraken tutorial) and I have
opened the public repositories that I have stored locally on my
computer. I can’t open the private ones yet, since I don’t have the
student developer pack through GitHub.</p>
<p>After fighting with GitHub student developer pack for a while, I got
it. They rejected me first, which I think is because my GitHub profile
didn’t have enough identifying information. So I added my name and
address to the billing information, a profile picture, a bio about me
being a Wake Forest student, my location, my full name displayed on the
profile, and connected my OrcID account. I can always remove things
later. I also got a enrollment verification that I tried submitting.
They didn’t want a pdf, so I converted it to a png. However, after
having submitted it once and gotten rejected, I wasn’t allowed to submit
the same documentation again (even though the problems were more likely
related to the GitHub profile information). I tried converting the pdf
to png again, hoping the document would have some different metadata and
that GitHub would let me submit it again, but that didn’t work.
Eventually, I had to print out my enrollment verification and take a
picture from my computer camera of the printed enrollment verification.
That got me verified within a few days. So, long story short, sign up to
GitHub with your student account to begin with. If you already have a
GitHub account, change all your profile information to identify who you
are and then hand in an application.</p>

<h2>Basic GUI of GitKraken</h2>
<p>Most of the notes here are taken from the <a
href="https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-desktop/interface/#elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0">GitKraken
help sides</a></p>
<p>There is a tool bar in the top middle of the screen when you open a
repository. It has several buttons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undo - Undo whatever change you just made. However, this only works
if you did the change locally, not remotely</li>
<li>Redo - Redo whatever undo you just made. Note that this only works
for local and not remote actions</li>
<li>Pull - This is to pull any changes. It will do a few different
things based on what you have set as your default. To see what you
default it (and change it) click on the little arrow and select another
option. “Fetch” will only get the change, but not merge it, while the
other options will do different levels of merging</li>
<li>Push - Pushes your changes remotely</li>
<li>Branch - Creates a new branch for whatever branch you are currently
selected (see the colored branches/bars on the timeline window for the
repository)</li>
<li>Stash - Stash something?</li>
<li>Pop - Pop your stash to your Whiip?</li>
<li>Terminal - Opens the terminal (think cmd) to Git. Has autocomplete
to guide you through using the terminal</li>

<h1>More Advanced Workflows</h1>
<p>Most of this material comes from the workflow part of the <a
href="https://learn.gitkraken.com/courses/git-foundations">Foundations
of Git Certification Course by GitKraken</a>. The rest, such as
trunk-based workflows and some further details come from various pages
on Google.</p>
<div id="the-different-types-of-workflows" class="section level2">
<h2>The Different Types of Workflows</h2>
<p>There are many types of workflows and after having gone over several
of them, I will highlight the characteristics of the main ones here and
then evaluate what I think seems to be the most relevant to the type of
work I do.</p>
<div id="github-flow" class="section level3">
<h3>GitHub flow</h3>
<p>GitHub flow is often used in scenarios when you do not have to
support multiple versions of a code. One maintains a main branch that is
only for code that has been tested and which we know work. Then, one
keep different feature branches, one branch per feature or bug fix, to
develop new features. When the code for the features is done, one can
create a pull request that someone else on the team can look over and
then merge that branch with the main branch.</p>
</div>
<div id="git-flow" class="section level3">
<h3>Git flow</h3>
<p>Git flow is a more elaborate strategy that involves many different
types of branches. This flow is especially helpful if one has several
versions of a product that has to be maintained at once.</p>
<p>The flow uses 5 different types of branches:</p>
<ul>
<li>main - Production-ready code that can be released</li>
<li>develop - Pre-production code with newly developed features that are
in the process of being tested</li>
<li>feature - Working on a new feature. This branch will typically be
merged with the develop branch as code is finished.</li>
<li>release - Finishing touches and minor bugs for preparing new
production releases</li>
<li>hotfix - Quickly address necessary changes in your main branch. You
typically branch this from your main branch and merge it with both the
main and develop branch afterward.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="trunk-based-flow" class="section level3">
<h3>Trunk-based flow</h3>
<p>The trunk-based flow involves a different view on branches, as having
many branches at once, especially those that last for a while, can
quickly lead to a lot of merge conflicts (the same code has been changed
by different people in different versions of the file, without updating
the file in-between). Therefore, this workflow uses minimal with feature
branches, only if necessary, for example if testing out a highly
experimental feature. If one uses a feature branch, this should pull and
push to the main branch as often as possible and should be merged back
into main as soon as possible too. The changes being made to the main
branch while checking out (working in) the main branch should also often
pull and push their changes as often as possible. This way, everyone are
working on updated versions of code and there will be minimal with merge
conflicts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="reflections-on-git-workflows" class="section level2">
<h2>Reflections on Git Workflows</h2>
<p>I don’t typically create code that needs to be in different versions,
so I think something like Git flow that has 5 different types of
branches might be a little more complicated than what I need. However, I
find the idea of using GitHub flow, with only feature and main branches,
intriguing. I get the benefit of using a trunk-based method, so that one
doesn’t have to deal with merge conflicts all the time. However, even
though it requires a little more work in terms of keeping an overview to
make sure features aren’t overlapping, it seems like the workflow could
be better organized with a flow like GitHub. For example, if working on
some data wrangling, I could have one branch for main, one for running
some more advanced models, one for data wrangling, and one for drawing
inferences from some statistical tests. This would separate the
different actions more and also give a much better overview (at least in
GitKraken) of the different mini-projects I am working on. I therefore
want to try out using GitHub with GitKraken and see how much of a
problem merge conflicts might become. If it gets too complicated, a
trunk-based method might be better. However, I do want to at least try
to GitHub flow method first.</p>
</div>
<div id="to-do-list" class="section level2">
<h2>To do list</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finish working through the GitKraken introductory course and get the
certification</li>
<li>Add the notes (that are currently hand-written) from the course to
this page</li>
<li>Practice some of the GitKraken features, for example by creating
pull requests to add the contract from project 1 to the course</li>
</ul>
